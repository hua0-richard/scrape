A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason, brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, ""Major D"" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee.
Contains One (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend Whole Bean 100% Arabica Coffee
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Flavorful, robust, full-bodied. Developed by Mr. Peet and his most discerning customer, Major Dickason’s Blend epitomizes the rich, flavorful taste of Peet’s
Brewing Methods: Use fine ground coffee for espresso at home. Coarsely ground coffee (consistency of coarse sea salt) can be used to make cold brew or a French press. Use a medium grind (consistency of sand) for drip or a pour over in your Chemex
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet.

Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet® decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, ""Major D"" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee.

It comes from the backyards and garden plots of small landholders, who often have only a few trees and process beans by hand, using the semi-washed method, that could be the secret to this coffee's unconstrained flavor and hefty, syrup-like body. Cherries are pulped on the farm with a hand-cranked mill, and the seeds hand washed in a basket. Collectors purchase and hull the coffee while still moist and dark grayish-green, removing the parchment shells and allowing the beans to sun-dry only briefly before delivering them to the port of Medan. Along the way, they become fully dry in stages—acquiring their characteristic Sumatran earthiness and complexity. Because each lot might include the beans of 100 different farmers, great Sumatra relies on strong relationships and sharp tasting skills. We sample exhaustively for every lot we select, looking for the most exceptional body and sweet herbal nuances to coax out with our signature Peet's roast. The result is a gutsy, glorious coffee that brews a richly seductive cup.

Slightly fry the ingredients from your chosen recipe or use them raw, place everything into the pots, put the pots into an oven or a microwave and go about your other home business. And in about an hour, in time for lunch or dinner, you will have a delicious and unique dish in a pot ready. Food baked in a pot makes a healthier eating choice. The pots are so special because they heat up slowly and evenly. The food in the pot is not boiling or frying, it is slowly baking and all nutrients are kept intact. There is another advantage for cooking in baking pots: individual approach to each family member or guest. Some people don`t like onions, some wish for a spicier dish, and you can serve to everyone`s taste now without any trouble, just what they prefer. Rounded porcelain pots from WILMAX look amazing on the table! Serve individual fragrant and delicious dishes in pots on your holiday table and your guests will be mightily impressed!

When he set up shop in Berkeley back in 1966, he transformed America’s expectations of the depth, body, and flavor in our cups. And that pursuit of greatness has never stopped. In 2016 we honored his legacy by taking a bold step ahead. Like Mr. Peet’s pioneering dark roasts, our signature medium roast blend expands the horizon of what coffee can be: vibrant, full-flavored, boldly original, and roasted to medium-bodied perfection. In 2022, we took things further, knowing that many love the smooth and balanced flavor of our most loved medium roast, but want it decaffeinated. If you love Major Dickason’s one-of-a-kind taste, you’ll find a kindred spirit in Big Bang™. This blend is crafted from some of the same premium coffees, as Major Dickason’s, but with a twist, thanks to the heavenly, aromatic citrus of Ethiopian Super Natural. It’s the perfect coffee to honor the man who still inspires us every day.
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's® Decaf Big Bang Decaffeinated Ground 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Medium Roast. Our most loved medium roast. Smooth with a balanced richness. Some have described Alfred Peet as the ""big bang"" of craft coffee—the one who started it all.
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home.
Decaf Done Differently: Every Peet’s® decaf is naturally water processed to remove caffeine—not flavor—before meticulous roasting. And by using the same high-quality coffee beans, you get a decaf that tastes as good as the real thing.
Rich. Complex. Incomparable. Masters of our craft for over 50 years, we hand roast the very best coffees in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78535702613,https://www.qfc.com/p/peet-s-decaf-big-bang-medium-roast-ground-coffee/0078535702613,2024-09-14T08:45:42.343172-04:00,OK

A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason, brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, ""Major D"" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee.

Colombia is synonymous with good coffee, and the country produces more washed Arabica beans than any other. But while the overall quality is consistent and familiar to the American palate, Colombia also produces exceptional coffees from specific micro-climates. Not one but three cordilleras traverse this enormous, emerald country and the variety of sun and rain regimes mean that harvesting is going on somewhere almost throughout the year. As always, we select by the cup, seeking the rarest lots of the brightest, sweetest, most exceptional beans. Our favorite, flavorful, full-bodied Colombian coffee comes from the heights of the remote southern province of Huila, a region that still grows the traditional typica beans along with the newer varieties. At the massif of two ranges, and the headwaters of a river that flows 950 miles north to the Caribbean, a small group of growers produce a shining, sweet and delicately fruited Colombia that has a taste unto its own.

Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, ""Major D"" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee.
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend Ground 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Flavorful, robust, full-bodied. Developed by Mr. Peet and his most discerning customer, Major Dickason’s Blend epitomizes the rich, flavorful taste of Peet’s.
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home.
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown.
Rich. Complex. Incomparable. Masters of our craft for over 50 years, we hand roast the very best coffees in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78535702350,https://www.qfc.com/p/peet-s-major-dickason-s-blend-dark-roast-ground-coffee/0078535702350,2024-09-14T09:19:15.384666-04:00,OK

In fact, we still have the Hair Bender sign in our headquarters, watching over us as we roast each batch. Hair Bender is a complex blend featuring coffee from three major growing regions; Central and South America, East Africa, and Indonesia. Its complexity is what allows for a harmonious flavor profile of sweet citrus, milk chocolate, and caramel. We continually taste this blend and each of its components, both on the cupping table as well as espresso, to best maintain the balance of flavors. Nearly 20 years ago, Stumptown Coffee Roasters began roasting exemplary coffee. Headquartered in Portland, Oregon, Stumptown is committed to sourcing, roasting and serving some of the best coffee in the world. Achieving B Corp status in 2018, Stumptown strives to be a leader in sustainability and is focused on making sincere and lasting contributions to the environment as well as to their employees and community.
Hair Bender: The sweet and balanced coffee that started it all. Hair Bender is our most celebrated blend with a flavor profile that shines no matter how you brew it.
Flavor: Hair Bender relies on coffees from Latin America, Indonesia, and Africa to achieve a complex flavor profile with notes of sweet citrus, dark chocolate, and raisin. 100% Arabica coffee.
Direct Trade: Our Direct Trade program is built on three principles: pay higher prices tied to quality; work with producers we know and maintain those relationships over many years; strive to build truly collaborative partnerships.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18062600015,https://www.qfc.com/p/stumptown-hair-bender-whole-bean-coffee/0018062600015,2024-09-14T09:26:01.414047-04:00,OK

A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason, brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, ""Major D"" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee.
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend Whole Bean 100% Arabica Coffee
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Flavorful, robust, full-bodied. Developed by Mr. Peet and his most discerning customer, Major Dickason’s Blend epitomizes the rich, flavorful taste of Peet’s
Brewing Methods: Use fine ground coffee for espresso at home. Coarsely ground coffee (consistency of coarse sea salt) can be used to make cold brew or a French press. Use a medium grind (consistency of sand) for drip or a pour over in your Chemex
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78535702357,https://www.qfc.com/p/peet-s-major-dickason-s-blend-dark-roast-whole-bean-coffee/0078535702357,2024-09-14T09:41:00.602284-04:00,OK

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78229050962,https://www.qfc.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-dark-roast-ground-coffee/0078229050962,2024-09-14T09:44:03.866441-04:00,OK

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78229050957,https://www.qfc.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-light-roast-whole-bean-coffee/0078229050957,2024-09-14T10:05:44.787126-04:00,OK

For our darkest roast, we select only top-quality Arabica coffee from the highest altitudes of prime Latin American growing regions. Beans mature slowly at these altitudes, becoming denser, harder and packed with flavor, perfect for retaining boldness and complexity under the intense heat of a deep roast. Peet's® French Roast is not a coffee for the cautious, but for those who embrace the powerful taste, pronounced smoky overtones, and pleasant bite. This dark, deeply flavorful blend pairs well with cream and sugar, and inspires reactions like this one from John ""Nic"" Nicolini, a Peet's® roaster for over 20 years: ""On a normal day, I cup 50 coffees before 7 a.m. But I always come back to French. You inhale that smoky aroma, and then a subtle sweetness pops out that awakens your taste buds. It’s visceral.""
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's® French Roast Whole Bean 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Chocolate truffle, smoke, caramel. The rich coffee character of French Roast comes from a short, intense roast, which not all beans can handle and Peet’s® has perfected.
Brewing Methods: Use fine ground coffee for espresso at home. Coarsely ground coffee (consistency of coarse sea salt) can be used to make cold brew or a French press. Use a medium grind (consistency of sand) for drip or a pour over in your Chemex.
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s® is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown.

So we used the exact same premium beans as the original to create a blend just as full of flavor, body, and aroma, but without any caffeine. The mellow, satisfying richness stands alone among decafs, whether prepared in a press, by drip, or as espresso. It's the boldest of its kind. A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason, brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup.

When he set up shop in Berkeley back in 1966, he transformed America’s expectations of the depth, body, and flavor in our cups. And that pursuit of greatness has never stopped. In 2016, we honored his legacy by taking a bold step ahead. Like Mr. Peet’s pioneering dark roasts, this blend expands the horizon of what coffee can be: vibrant, full-flavored, boldly original, and roasted to medium-bodied perfection. If you love Major Dickason’s one-of-a-kind taste, you’ll find a kindred spirit in Big Bang®. This blend is crafted from some of the same premium coffees as Major Dickason’s but with a twist, thanks to the heavenly, aromatic citrus of Ethiopian Super Natural.

To produce this coffee, coffee berries are eaten by the Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries come in contact with proteolytic enzymes, which change the composition of the coffee berries. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts it life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet and therefore the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,79460440082,https://www.qfc.com/p/kaya-kopi-honey-whole-bean-coffee/0079460440082,2024-09-14T11:30:11.424377-04:00,OK

This pre-brewed espresso powder readily dissolves in hot, near boiling water, for a drink and can also be added to desserts and baked goods. Instant espresso powder is a best-kept secret to creating rich chocolate desserts and baked goods. Its deep complex flavor makes chocolate desserts richer. Just a teaspoon or two amplifies and complements chocolate flavor without imparting any distinct coffee flavor. If you prefer a mocha-style coffee flavor added to your chocolate recipes, add more espresso powder.
100% ESPRESSO: Rich, intense pre-brewed espresso. Contains Caffeine
READY TO USE POWDER: Fine Ground powder (not granules): Our Instant Espresso Powder is pre-brewed and ready to dissolve instantly in hot water, liquids or baking mixes.
ESSENTIAL BAKING INGREDIENT: Espresso powder intensifies chocolate flavor, giving desserts a rich, dark chocolate flavor. Essential ingredient for classic Italian Tiramisu.
GREAT FOR COFFEE DRINKS: Use in lattes, hot cocoa, frozen coffee drinks, Dalgona Whipped Coffee and even chocolate martinis!

Practiced by coffee lovers worldwide, this time-tested Japanese coffee brewing method, also called hand drip coffee, allows complete control over coffee to water ratio and brew time using a slow, precise water flow that's critical to extracting a consistent, rich quality and distinctly flavorful result. The high-heat borosilicate glass carafe resists shock and breakage and won't absorb odors or transfer flavors between brews. The pierced 18/8 stainless steel microfilter captures and filters out more sediment than traditional reusable coffee filters and allows the natural coffee oils to contribute to each brew's complex flavor. It eliminates the use of paper coffee filters, which can strip out these flavorful oils. Brew only what's needed for less waste. Ideal for single cup coffee up to 2-cups, for consistent flavor and a fresh cup every time. Serve coffee immediately or chill for coffee drinks or iced coffee. A must-have of coffee gifts and coffee accessories, Aerlatte's Drip Coffee Brewer is hand washable in warm, soapy water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,503917900127,https://www.qfc.com/p/aerolatte-borosilicate-glass-drip-coffee-brewer-and-microfilter/0503917900127,2024-09-14T11:58:31.012826-04:00,OK

Peet's Single Origin Brazil Medium Roast Coffee is from Minas Gerais, the biggest—and we think best—producing state in Brazil. The natural method of bean preparation is used and what we most prefer in this part of the world. It takes plenty of sun to dry all the way through the skin and sweet pulp of the coffee fruit to the seeds inside. This is done on well-tended patios, where whole cherries are raked continuously, and also on the trees, where a portion of the pickings are left to dry on the branch. All of our favorite farms also produce coffees by the ""pulped natural"" method, which involves removing the skin and some of the fruit pulp from the outset, and the ""washed"" method, which fully removes it, as is the standard in countries like Costa Rica. In Brazil, with lower altitudes and less acidity, we find the typical washed coffee to be somewhat bland. Single Origin Brazil, formerly known as Brazil Minas Naturais, is anything but, making maximal effect of slow sun drying for a thoroughly sweet cup with mild fruit and caramel notes and smooth, full body.
Contians one (1) 18 Ounce Bag of Peet's Single Origin Brazil Whole Bean 100% Arabica Coffee
Flavor and Roast: Medium Roast. Balanced, dried fruit, hazelnut. Whole, ripe coffee cherries from the Minas Gerais region sweeten in the Brazilian sun to create a coffee that is smooth and full-bodied
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and grinding at home
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown","Nutrition Facts

We started with a coffee from the Huila region in Colombia's highlands, a place where beans are cultivated over 4,500 feet and known for their smooth, sweet character. Then to Ethiopia, coffee's birthplace, where unique varieties yield exquisite coffees with delicate aromas. Formerly known as Colombia Luminosa, we approached this bright blend, our first light roast, as we do all our coffees: carefully select the very best beans, then hand roast them in small batches to achieve their utmost flavor.

Flavor and Roast: Light Roast. Light, sweet, aromatic. Luminosa means ""shining"" or ""bright,"" and this blend enlightens the subtle sweetness of Colombia with just the right touch of Ethiopian floral aromatics
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home

Peet's® French Roast is not a coffee for the cautious, but for those who embrace the powerful taste, pronounced smoky overtones, and pleasant bite. This dark, deeply flavorful blend pairs well with cream and sugar, and inspires reactions like this one from John ""Nic"" Nicolini, a Peet's® roaster for over 20 years: ""On a normal day, I cup 50 coffees before 7 a.m. But I always come back to French. You inhale that smoky aroma, and then a subtle sweetness pops out that awakens your taste buds. It’s visceral.""
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's® French Roast Ground 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Chocolate truffle, smoke, caramel. The rich coffee character of French Roast comes from a short, intense roast, which not all beans can handle and Peet’s® has perfected.
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home.
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s® is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown.

Its elegant design brews up to 3 servings (with a total 12-ounce capacity). Perfect for the coffee enthusiast or at-home baristas, it's designed to extract the most flavor from ground coffee and achieve a more flavorful brew without buying expensive machines that hog up precious counter space. Water levels marked on the glass, along with the included coffee scoop, help measure the precise water-to-coffee ratio for the perfect cup every time. Its plunger lid, with a built-in microfilter in the spout, pushes grounds to the bottom of the pot and filters out sediment when pouring fresh-brewed coffee. Simply measure medium-ground coffee directly into the glass (approximately 2 rounded tablespoons per 8-ounces of water, or to desired taste). Pour in a small amount of boiled water, gently stir grounds so they sink, and wait 30 seconds for coffee to 'bloom' in the water so it releases more flavor. After the 30 seconds, pour in the rest of the water. Position the plunger lid inside the pot with the filter just above, and level to, the water line. Allow coffee to brew for 3 to 5 minutes. Once coffee is brewed, slowly plunge the grounds (about 20 seconds) to the bottom of the pot. Grounds will continue to brew at the bottom of the pot and make coffee even stronger. Be sure to pour and enjoy coffee immediately. Made from high borosilicate glass and stainless steel, Aerolatte's French Press Coffee Maker is easy to use and clean. The durable glass beaker easily lifts out from the frame for cleaning. All parts are Proposition 65 compliant and dishwasher safe for easy cleanup.

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78229050959,https://www.qfc.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-dark-roast-whole-bean-coffee/0078229050959,2024-09-14T13:25:27.233225-04:00,OK

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71158359843,https://www.qfc.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-whole-bean-coffee/0071158359843,2024-09-14T13:37:54.368035-04:00,OK
