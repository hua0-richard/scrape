For our darkest roast, we select only top-quality Arabica coffee from the highest altitudes of prime Latin American growing regions. Beans mature slowly at these altitudes, becoming denser, harder and packed with flavor, perfect for retaining boldness and complexity under the intense heat of a deep roast. Peet's® French Roast is not a coffee for the cautious, but for those who embrace the powerful taste, pronounced smoky overtones, and pleasant bite. This dark, deeply flavorful blend pairs well with cream and sugar, and inspires reactions like this one from John ""Nic"" Nicolini, a Peet's® roaster for over 20 years: ""On a normal day, I cup 50 coffees before 7 a.m. But I always come back to French. You inhale that smoky aroma, and then a subtle sweetness pops out that awakens your taste buds. It’s visceral.""
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's® French Roast Ground 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Chocolate truffle, smoke, caramel. The rich coffee character of French Roast comes from a short, intense roast, which not all beans can handle and Peet’s® has perfected.
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home.
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s® is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown.
Rich. Complex. Incomparable. Masters of our craft for over 50 years, we hand roast the very best coffees in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78535702552.0,https://www.ralphs.com/p/peet-s-french-roast-dark-roast-ground-coffee/0078535702552,2024-09-17T12:36:08.421413-04:00,OK

Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home

This pre-brewed espresso powder readily dissolves in hot, near boiling water, for a drink and can also be added to desserts and baked goods. Instant espresso powder is a best-kept secret to creating rich chocolate desserts and baked goods. Its deep complex flavor makes chocolate desserts richer. Just a teaspoon or two amplifies and complements chocolate flavor without imparting any distinct coffee flavor. If you prefer a mocha-style coffee flavor added to your chocolate recipes, add more espresso powder.
100% ESPRESSO: Rich, intense pre-brewed espresso. Contains Caffeine
READY TO USE POWDER: Fine Ground powder (not granules): Our Instant Espresso Powder is pre-brewed and ready to dissolve instantly in hot water, liquids or baking mixes.
ESSENTIAL BAKING INGREDIENT: Espresso powder intensifies chocolate flavor, giving desserts a rich, dark chocolate flavor. Essential ingredient for classic Italian Tiramisu.
GREAT FOR COFFEE DRINKS: Use in lattes, hot cocoa, frozen coffee drinks, Dalgona Whipped Coffee and even chocolate martinis!

No fluff, no lines, just full-flavored specialty coffee brewed at home. Our vast selection of Whole Bean and Ground coffees will tantalize your taste buds and wake you up for the new day. From Organic blends to flavored blends you’ve only dreamt of, Cameron’s Coffee is committed to bringing the perfect cup of coffee straight to your kitchen. Since 1978, Cameron's has been a name synonymous with specialty coffee rich in flavor, yet subtle and complex. We purchase our specialty grade, Arabica coffee beans from around the globe and ""small batch"" roast them to perfection in one of the finest roasteries in the country. The quality and consistency of our coffee is sure to please even the most sophisticated coffee drinker. Taste the flavor, enjoy the moment and share in a cup of coffee so full of character we're proud to call it Cameron's.From the ManufacturerRich in flavor. Subtle, yet complex. Just a few words that have been describing Cameron's coffee since 1978. What can we say? It's all in the bean. After seeking out the world's finest plantations, we select only the highest flavor-quality Arabica beans. These beans are typically grown at a high altitude, usually 4,000-5,000 feet above sea level. The higher altitude makes the coffee cherry mature slower and stay on the tree longer, resulting in a coffee bean that is more dense, less acidic and has naturally lower levels of caffeine. Then, we carefully blend and roast them in small batches and rush them fresh to you. Is it worth the effort? Taste for yourself. We have a hunch you’ll be savoring the true character one delicious sip after the other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,74615581264.0,https://www.ralphs.com/p/cameron-s-coffee-toasted-southern-pecan-case-of-6-12-ct/0074615581264,2024-09-17T13:31:23.657744-04:00,OK

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71158359844.0,https://www.ralphs.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-whole-bean-coffee/0071158359844,2024-09-17T14:13:39.416149-04:00,OK
