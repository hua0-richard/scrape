It thoughtfully travels in a shelf-stable package that keeps its chocolatey contents fresh, so you can store it in your cupboard, ready to be deployed in case of any chocolate emergencies—which actually occur way more often than you might think.

Because stevia leaf extract is 200x sweeter than sugar, we balance the sweetness with erythritol, a sweetener produced by fermentation. Erythritol is also found in fruits like grapes and pears.
