This non-dairy beverage is a super-sustainable substitute for creamers, frothers, sweeteners, and drink additives.
Try it in coffee or tea, hot or iced, and anywhere you want luscious, lactose-free flavor. Oh, and this barista will always get your name right
We enlisted the help of a world-class barista to ensure Oatsome matches or exceeds the frothing quality of any milk (or milk alternative) on the market. Oatsome makes fantastically frothable rich and creamy lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and more
The rumours are true - anything you can do with milk, you can do with Oatsome. So the next time you're cooking up a storm - or a soup - in the kitchen, go ahead and switch milk for Oatsome. Need inspiration? Our recipes page is here to help","Nutrition Facts

This rich, creamy, and caffeine-free root beer is a timeless treat that has been a family favorite for over 100 years since it was first sold at a roadside stand in Lodi, California in 1919. Family nights just aren’t the same without the sweet taste of A&W Root Beer. Whether you’re watching a movie, enjoying a board game, or simply enjoying the great outdoors gathered around a campfire, A&W Root Beer makes the night that much sweeter. Although you can easily enjoy it all by itself in a frosty mug, nothing quite beats the taste of an A&W Root Beer Float. Just drop in a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream into the mug before filling it to the rim. Pop in a paper straw to complete the look before taking a sip of 100% pure joy. For a truly decadent experience, try the Campfire, Brownie Sundae, or Salted Caramel variations found at RootBeer.com. No matter how you float, you can’t go wrong with an A&W Root Beer!
ROOT BEER: Classic American root beer with a sweet, indulgent taste and smooth, creamy finish
CAFFEINE FREE: Sweet treat doesn’t contain caffeine so you can enjoy it day or night
ICE CREAM FLOATS: There’s nothing that can top a classic A&W Root Beer Float unless you prefer a Campfire, Brownie Sundae, or Salted Caramel version.
TRUSTED SINCE 1919: A&W Root Beer has been an American classic since it was first sold at a roadside stand in California in 1919

Our Organic Chai comes packaged with 16 individual tea bags for your sipping pleasure, and it's Kosher, Fair Trade and Non-GMO Project Verified. By the way, brewing's also a cinch: Just bring fresh, filtered water to a boil, carefully pour water over your black tea bag, and let it steep for 5 minutes (the longest 5 minutes, we know). Then, you’re good to take that first sip! At TAZO®, we’re a group of tea-obsessed people on a mission to challenge the status quo. This doesn’t stop at exciting, new tea blends; it continues with making the world a better place. That means investing in regenerative growing practices. Stepping up for environmental justice. And shining a spotlight on important issues (like the climate crisis) to help our communities—and the planet. So choose your favorite blend, brew a cup, and let's stir things up.
TAZO® Regenerative – Organic Chai brings together the richest spices from all around the world
This blend combines bold black teas with warm notes of ginger, cardamom, and cinnamon
Caffeine? Just the right for an invigorating morning or afternoon pick-me-up black tea
Easy prep: bring fresh, filtered water to a boil, pour over tea bag, and steep for 5 minutes

Infused with antioxidants and made with no artificial sweeteners, Bai Kupang Strawberry Kiwi is gluten free, kosher with low glycemic index, and overflowing with strawberry kiwi flavor. H2O is one of the most powerful - and essential - elements on the planet. At Bai, we’ve reimagined and expanded water’s superpowers beyond basic hydration. And we really went for it. Bai is…. vitamin C and antioxidant-infused, exotic-Flavored, infused with little-known coffee fruit, tea extract infused for natural caffeine, naturally sweetened, colored & flavored, and contains 1 gram of sugar and 10 calories per bottle. Bai is a plant-powered antioxidant infusion that delivers more than you’ve ever expected from regular H2O. We wondered what water could truly be, and we made it wonderful. A drink that tastes great and is also good for you? It’ll be love at first sip.
