Using top-quality grain, mellowed white oak barrels, and that pristine water, we created an easygoing classic whisky to be enjoyed by all. Canadian Mists's distillery is Canada's oldest continuously owned and operated distillery. The distillery is located in Collingwood, Ontario, at the foot of the Blue Mountain and overlooks Georgian Bay. Barley malt, rye, and corn are all sourced locally in Canada. The grains are ground, mixed with water and then mashed to extract their starches. Enzymes in the ground grain convert the starches to sugar, then this converted mash is sent to the fermenter. Yeast is added and fermentation begins. Sugar is converted to alcohol along with some trace flavor compounds known as congeners. The fermented grain mash is now called a “beer”. This is distilled to separate the alcohol. Exposed to steam, the whisky is vaporized and sent to a condenser. The condensed vapor is now known as “high wine.” This new whisky is mingled with water and steam through two columns, which separate out some of the congeners. The remaining congeners are what gives Canadian Mist its flavor and aroma.

Every member of the Diamond Collection is a testament to the family's craftsmanship and the perfect gift to ""celebrate the love of life"".

With floral aromas on the nose, the vibrant palate offers flavors of fresh strawberries, complemented by a crisp, refreshing finish. A sparkling wine that can easily be enjoyed on its own or for Holiday celebrations with a variety of dishes. After the initial winemaking process is complete, a small amount of finished wine is separated and passed through a spinning cone machine that gently removes the alcohol. This alcohol-removed wine is then blended back into the traditional wine resulting in a final blend of delicious, reduced-alcohol wine with 25% fewer calories and half the sugar of the original wine. This bottled wine has 8.75% alcohol by volume. Mind & Body wines are dedicated to empowering you to live your best life.

Crafted with the same passion and determination he brings to his films, the Diamond Collection is a tribute to all those dreamers and risk-takers like himself. Every member of the Diamond Collection is a testament to the family's craftsmanship and the perfect gift to ""celebrate the love of life"". Our Cabernet Sauvignon is a full-bodied and intense red wine that holds a true complexity by blending fruit from contrasting soil compositions and climates. The perfect pairing for any meal, this is a classic California Cab Sav with immediate drinkability. Watch it dazzle like the gem it is at your next dinner party with friends. Ready for a glass? Join the Coppola family, get a glimpse of beautiful Sonoma County, and savor a real taste of the diamond life.

The initial intent was to make wines that tasted like the best California had to offer, but were priced so that everyone could enjoy them. Developed strong relationships with the owners and growers of some of the best and most coveted vineyards in Sonoma, working with them to produce wines of depth, purity and balance. In 2013, the refreshing and relaxed Banshee tasting room opened in downtown Healdsburg in the heart of Sonoma County. Our main focus for Pinot Noir is on the cool, rugged, coastal areas of the far Western Sonoma Coast. An exciting, yet friendly wine, bursting at the seams with aromas of dried cherry, earthy peat moss and Redwood forest with notes of hyacinth, sandalwood and confectioners sugar. The flavors combine to create a fruit-driven front palate and very subtle oak influence. The finish is bright, with a nice pop of acidity and flavors of tart raspberry and bramble to create great weight for an excellent food wine, as well as a charming drinking experience by itself.

Though the first few centuries yielded a beverage quite unlike that of today, years of experience perfected brewing techniques and increased sake's overall appeal and popularity. In 1905, the brand name GEKKEIKAN (meaning ""crown of laurel"") was adopted as the company's formal pledge to excellence. Through this commitment, the company became a true leader in the industry and pioneered a number of research and development efforts.

Charring is an age-old method for invigorating barrels to intensify the taste. Time spent maturing in these double-charred barrels lends our whiskey a unique richness, with more intensified notes of vanilla sweetness and caramel, alongside toasted wood, fruit, and warm spice. We always like to say that everything you need to know about Jameson is right here - either on our bottle or in our bottle -encapsulating our full story. The label features our family crest and motto. Proclaiming 'Sine Metu', it means 'Without Fear'. It's the reason John Jameson first triple distilled Irish whiskey, creating Jameson Irish Whiskey as we know it. So in the spirit of Sine Metu, let us take you on a journey. Pull up a chair....
BLACK BARREL EDITION: Double charring the wood fires up the barrels; richness and complexity in every drop of Jameson Black Barrel Irish Whiskey
ENJOY RESPONSIBLY: Each 750 ml bottle of Jameson Black Barrel Irish Whiskey is 80 proof, 40% ABV; Drink Responsibly
CONSUMPTION TIP: It's perfect on its own or on the rocks, but it's also commonly known as the best whiskey for an Old Fashioned
TRIPLE DISTILLED: Double charring the wood fires up the barrels and gives them new life; untold richness awaits in every Jameson Black Barrel
FLAVOR & NOTES: Maturing of these barrels leads to aromas of butterscotch, fudge and creamy toffee; A taste of nutty notes and smooth sweetness","Nutrition Facts

A monster ABV and booming hop character, but tame sweetness and a clean finish? This anomaly of imperial IPA starts with the mash. More than just using a huge volume of malt (and we do fill our mill to overflowing), we mash our grain aggressively to yield a higher ratio of fermentable vs. unfermentable sugars. This allows yeast to metabolize nearly all sugar, which both boosts the ABV and cuts the malt sweetness. At the same time, yeast and hops collaborate on their own magic. Dry hopping during active fermentation sparks biotransformation: yeast cells alter the chemical compounds in hops to unlock entirely new aromas—like the tropical wave that washes over Big Little Thing.

Taylor Fladgate is an area leader in winemaking technology, as one of only three Porto producers to pioneer the development of piston fermenter techniques, called Port Toes, that extract significantly greater flavor and aroma than conventional pump-over fermentation. Fermentation is halted by the addition of grape spirits before all the residual sugar has been fermented, creating a sweet, fortified wine. Individual wines produced in different vintages are aged in 600-liter oak casks for years, over which time they will lose their young, dark purple-black color to gain the distinctive “tawny” hue from which the wine takes its name. As tawnies age, the wines take on increasingly more nutty flavors and become more concentrated as the barrels lose 3% of their volume every year (the “Angels’ Share”) to evaporation. The 10 Year Old Tawny is a blend created using tawnies with an average of 10 years of aging.

Unlike other gins which boil their botanicals with the spirit, the Bombay spirit is distilled alone. To achieve the unique flavor, the spirit passes through the botanicals in vapor form. This allows each delicate aroma to be fully absorbed. The result is a complex, yet subtle taste sensation.

Due to its especially high rye content, Bulleit Bourbon has a bold, spicy character with a finish that's distinctively clean and smooth. Medium amber in color, with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas, the mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak, and nutmeg.

Once we’re brewing, this precise grain foundation interacts with the polyphenols (think pre-haze molecules) in colossal volumes of lupulin hop dust, which is basically the pure flavor from inside hop cones, to generate a smooth and juicy haze.

So, from the agaves we grow, to the production of the bottle, sustainability and transparency of our supply chain is our core focus.
