For almost 5,000 years, tea drinkers around the world have embraced its delicious taste, enlivening aroma, and revitalizing flavors. Lipton Green Tea is picked while young, giving it a fresher, lighter flavor characterized by a crisp flavor and natural earthiness. We think our green tea blend is ideal for focusing and reviving. Try it hot and fresh to start your day or iced and refreshing for a mid-day cool down or snack break. For balanced flavor, we recommend steeping Lipton Green Tea in water that’s just under boiling, and only for two minutes so it retains all those lovely, fresh, and energizing flavors. Plus, since each cup of tea is 99.5% water, it helps keep the body hydrated and balanced.","Nutrition Facts

It restores important mineral salts and fluids lost through dehydration, physical exertion, and heat stress. The Sqwincher Zero Qwik Stik Tube has zero sugar and only 5 calories. As a sports drink, it helps replace electrolytes lost in high-heat environments because of excessive sweating, stress, and fatigue, all without extra sugar calories. Rehydrating Sqwincher drink mix is satisfying and absorbs significantly faster than water or any soft drink. This is because the body absorbs it more quickly and restores proper electrolyte and fluid balance, allowing for the replenishment of electrolytes and minerals needed for rehydration. It has twice the potassium and half the sodium compared to other sports drinks used in the industry. The lemonade flavor has a great taste and comes in a powdered concentrate form. It comes in single-serve pouches that yield up to 20 ounces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7588021204,https://www.qfc.com/p/sqwincher-quik-stik-zero-oral-electrolyte-solution-lemonade-0-11-oz-packet-50-ct/0007588021204,2024-09-13T04:57:02.468209-04:00,OK

It’s a good source of complete protein, healthy fats, and minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. We all know that goats are adorable, fun-loving animals to have around, but they also have a much smaller environmental ‘hoofprint’ than other livestock raised for dairy. Not only do they need less water per gallon of milk produced, but they also produce much less methane than dairy cows per kilogram of body weight!

This great-tasting clear hydrolyte thickened water is lemon-flavor and contains other natural flavors.

This rich, creamy, and caffeine-free root beer is a timeless treat that has been a family favorite for over 100 years since it was first sold at a roadside stand in Lodi, California in 1919. Family nights just aren’t the same without the sweet taste of A&W Root Beer. Whether you’re watching a movie, enjoying a board game, or simply enjoying the great outdoors gathered around a campfire, A&W Root Beer makes the night that much sweeter. Although you can easily enjoy it all by itself in a frosty mug, nothing quite beats the taste of an A&W Root Beer Float. Just drop in a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream into the mug before filling it to the rim. Pop in a paper straw to complete the look before taking a sip of 100% pure joy. For a truly decadent experience, try the Campfire, Brownie Sundae, or Salted Caramel variations found at RootBeer.com. No matter how you float, you can’t go wrong with an A&W Root Beer!
ROOT BEER: Classic American root beer with a sweet, indulgent taste and smooth, creamy finish
CAFFEINE FREE: Sweet treat doesn’t contain caffeine so you can enjoy it day or night
ICE CREAM FLOATS: There’s nothing that can top a classic A&W Root Beer Float unless you prefer a Campfire, Brownie Sundae, or Salted Caramel version.
TRUSTED SINCE 1919: A&W Root Beer has been an American classic since it was first sold at a roadside stand in California in 1919
