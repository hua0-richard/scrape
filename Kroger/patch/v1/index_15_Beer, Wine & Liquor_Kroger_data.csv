Enduring the twists and turns, peaks and valleys (and multiple brushes with bankruptcy) along that winding road, Francis Coppola never gave up on his desire to create a wine designed ""to celebrate the love of life."" Crafted with the same passion and determination he brings to his films, the Diamond Collection is a tribute to all those dreamers and risk-takers like himself. Every member of the Diamond Collection is a testament to the family's craftsmanship and the perfect gift to ""celebrate the love of life"". Our Pinot Grigio white wine is grown in California's cooler appellations where chilly evening temps and a regular incursion of fog help the grapes retain their natural acidity. The result – a crisp and citrusy wine that is both smooth and balanced. Watch it dazzle like the gem it is at your next dinner party. Ready for a glass? Join the Coppola family, get a glimpse of beautiful Sonoma County, and savor a real taste of the diamond life.

Fourth generation farmer Ron McManis, and his wife Jamie, founded McManis Family Vineyards in 1990. From the beginning, their mission was simple: every bottle of McManis Family Vineyards should consist of ""quality wine at an honest price"". They now farm over 3,600 acres of premium wine grapes from premier growing areas across the state. In 1998, the company designed and built a state-of-the-art winery to produce a range of red and white varietals sourced from ten estate vineyards. All 10 delicious varietals are certified sustainable under Lodi Rules standards and the winery itself is certified under California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance. McManis is also the keeper of the third smallest American Viticultural Area (AVA) in California. Nestled between the cool confluence of the Stanislaus and San Joaquin rivers, south of Lodi, the River Junction Appellation comprises 1300 acres. The land near the river basin is consistently 2-5 degrees cooler than the surrounding farmlands, combined with the sandy loam soils unique to the area, is ideally suited to growing premium quality grapes. This geographical advantage also provides a more significant diurnal temperature swing - warm days, cooler nights than other vineyards. McManis Family Vineyards grows Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, Viognier and Muscat Canelli in the AVA.

Crafted with the same passion and determination he brings to his films, the Diamond Collection is a tribute to all those dreamers and risk-takers like himself. Every member of the Diamond Collection is a testament to the family's craftsmanship and the perfect gift to ""celebrate the love of life"". Our crown jewel, the Claret Cabernet Sauvignon red wine, is a Bordeaux-style blend made from grapes found all across the state of California. Every bottle of Claret reflects a diversity of varietals and vineyards whose soils contribute to the wine's complexity.

Traditional sangria is a blend of wine and fruit flavors for a sweet and festive drink. Its origins can be traced to the southern region of Spain, where it was first used as a refreshing way to endure the summer's heat. Americans had their first sip of sangria at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. The Spanish Pavillion served the sweet and refreshing drink to thirsty visitors and it was an instant success. Sangria quickly became an essential drink of the new century. Since then, Sangria has gone from being a popular beverage seen predominantly at Spanish restaurants to its current position as the go-to drink for when friends and family get together. Whatever the occasion, keep it real with Real Sangria.

The initial intent was to make wines that tasted like the best California had to offer, but were priced so that everyone could enjoy them. Developed strong relationships with the owners and growers of some of the best and most coveted vineyards in Sonoma, working with them to produce wines of depth, purity and balance. In 2013, the refreshing and relaxed Banshee tasting room opened in downtown Healdsburg in the heart of Sonoma County. Our main focus for Pinot Noir is on the cool, rugged, coastal areas of the far Western Sonoma Coast. An exciting, yet friendly wine, bursting at the seams with aromas of dried cherry, earthy peat moss and Redwood forest with notes of hyacinth, sandalwood and confectioners sugar. The flavors combine to create a fruit-driven front palate and very subtle oak influence. The finish is bright, with a nice pop of acidity and flavors of tart raspberry and bramble to create great weight for an excellent food wine, as well as a charming drinking experience by itself.

Enduring the twists and turns, peaks and valleys (and multiple brushes with bankruptcy) along that winding road, Francis Coppola never gave up on his desire to create a wine designed ""to celebrate the love of life."" Crafted with the same passion and determination he brings to his films, the Diamond Collection is a tribute to all those dreamers and risk-takers like himself. Every member of the Diamond Collection is a testament to the family's craftsmanship and the perfect gift to ""celebrate the love of life"". Our Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon is an exciting, full-bodied addition to our collection, made with grapes found in Paso Robles, CA. With this unique appellation, known for topography, soils, and meso-climates, each bottle brings an intense red wine experience sure to please the most sophisticated of palates, making it an exceptional gift idea, or dinner party essential. So, join the Coppola family, get a glimpse of beautiful Sonoma County, and savor a real taste of the diamond life.

Though the first few centuries yielded a beverage quite unlike that of today, years of experience perfected brewing techniques and increased sake's overall appeal and popularity. In 1905, the brand name GEKKEIKAN (meaning ""crown of laurel"") was adopted as the company's formal pledge to excellence. Through this commitment, the company became a true leader in the industry and pioneered a number of research and development efforts. The successful results of these endeavors have enabled Gekkeikan to become one of the nation's most popular brands. Gekkeikan's passion for pleasing the sake connoisseur remains unchanged.

The winery offers pinot noir as well as small amounts of pinot gris,pinot blanc and chardonnay. The wines are produced from our three estate vineyards – Foley Family Estate, Doe Ridge Estate, Weathergage Estate and other top sites in the Willamette Valley. Highly acclaimed, The Four Graces wines are hand-crafted in small lots using traditional techniques coupled with the most modern technology in winemaking. The 2021 vintage will be remembered in the Willamette Valley for record setting heat and dry conditions. Mild rain during bloom reduced the yields to slightly below average, but the precipitation helped our vines tolerate the unusually hot and dry summer. Harvest began a few weeks earlier than average, with our first pinot noir coming from the Dundee Hills and Ribbon Ridge AVAs on Septem-ber 12th. Our Doe Ridge and Weathergage Estate Vineyards were close behind and by the end of the month all of our pinot noir was harvested. All of the fruit harvested was very high quality, with ripe and concentrated flavors. The fruit for this wine was sourced from our estate vineyards: Foley Family in the Dundee Hills AVA, Doe Ridge in the Yamhill-Carlton AVA and Weathergage in the Van Duzer Corridor AVA; as well as select sites throughout the Willamette Valley AVA. Additional fruit from the Ribbon Ridge AVA make up the final blend. The 2021 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir showcases a beautiful ruby hue in the glass.

As Summer approached, the classic warm days and cool nights made for ideal growing conditions without any major heat waves. During the harvest we received less than average rainfall, which allowed for nearly perfect harvesting conditions.
