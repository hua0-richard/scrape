To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0078229050962,https://www.kroger.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-dark-roast-ground-coffee/0078229050962,2024-09-15T17:21:29.032677-04:00,OK

For our darkest roast, we select only top-quality Arabica coffee from the highest altitudes of prime Latin American growing regions. Beans mature slowly at these altitudes, becoming denser, harder and packed with flavor, perfect for retaining boldness and complexity under the intense heat of a deep roast. Peet's® French Roast is not a coffee for the cautious, but for those who embrace the powerful taste, pronounced smoky overtones, and pleasant bite. This dark, deeply flavorful blend pairs well with cream and sugar, and inspires reactions like this one from John ""Nic"" Nicolini, a Peet's® roaster for over 20 years: ""On a normal day, I cup 50 coffees before 7 a.m. But I always come back to French. You inhale that smoky aroma, and then a subtle sweetness pops out that awakens your taste buds. It’s visceral.""
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's® French Roast Ground 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Chocolate truffle, smoke, caramel. The rich coffee character of French Roast comes from a short, intense roast, which not all beans can handle and Peet’s® has perfected.
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home.
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s® is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown.
Rich. Complex. Incomparable. Masters of our craft for over 50 years, we hand roast the very best coffees in the world.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0078535702552,https://www.kroger.com/p/peet-s-french-roast-dark-roast-ground-coffee/0078535702552,2024-09-15T17:28:09.779510-04:00,OK

In fact, we still have the Hair Bender sign in our headquarters, watching over us as we roast each batch. Hair Bender is a complex blend featuring coffee from three major growing regions; Central and South America, East Africa, and Indonesia. Its complexity is what allows for a harmonious flavor profile of sweet citrus, milk chocolate, and caramel. We continually taste this blend and each of its components, both on the cupping table as well as espresso, to best maintain the balance of flavors. Nearly 20 years ago, Stumptown Coffee Roasters began roasting exemplary coffee. Headquartered in Portland, Oregon, Stumptown is committed to sourcing, roasting and serving some of the best coffee in the world. Achieving B Corp status in 2018, Stumptown strives to be a leader in sustainability and is focused on making sincere and lasting contributions to the environment as well as to their employees and community.
Hair Bender: The sweet and balanced coffee that started it all. Hair Bender is our most celebrated blend with a flavor profile that shines no matter how you brew it.
Flavor: Hair Bender relies on coffees from Latin America, Indonesia, and Africa to achieve a complex flavor profile with notes of sweet citrus, dark chocolate, and raisin. 100% Arabica coffee.

Colombia is synonymous with good coffee, and the country produces more washed Arabica beans than any other. But while the overall quality is consistent and familiar to the American palate, Colombia also produces exceptional coffees from specific micro-climates. Not one but three cordilleras traverse this enormous, emerald country and the variety of sun and rain regimes mean that harvesting is going on somewhere almost throughout the year. As always, we select by the cup, seeking the rarest lots of the brightest, sweetest, most exceptional beans. Our favorite, flavorful, full-bodied Colombian coffee comes from the heights of the remote southern province of Huila, a region that still grows the traditional typica beans along with the newer varieties. At the massif of two ranges, and the headwaters of a river that flows 950 miles north to the Caribbean, a small group of growers produce a shining, sweet and delicately fruited Colombia that has a taste unto its own.
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's Single Origin Colombia Ground 100% Arabica Coffee
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Bright, ripe cherry, toasted nut. With a preference for the high southern department of Huila, we select only exceptional beans to produce the most flavorful Colombian cup
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and grinding at home
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown","Nutrition Facts

As a result, Cafe Altura, the first organic coffee company in the United States, was created to share organic beans sourced from farms around the world with coffee lovers everywhere. We roast only the highest quality beans, which deliver a rich, flavorful cup of coffee with a seductive aroma and smooth finish. Coffee grown the way Nature intended.

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0071158359843,https://www.kroger.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-whole-bean-coffee/0071158359843,2024-09-15T19:08:46.617362-04:00,OK

A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason, brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet® in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet® decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, ""Major D"" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee.
Contains one (1) Box of 32 Peet's® Major Dickason's Blend Dark Roast Coffee Keurig® K-Cup® Pods - 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Flavorful, robust, full-bodied. Developed by Mr. Peet® and his most discerning customer, Major Dickason’s Blend epitomizes the rich, flavorful taste of Peet’s®.
Brewing Methods: Peet's® single serve, K-Cup® Pods are compatible with all Keurig® K-Cup® Brewers.

It's taken more than 10 years to identify every step of performance-robbing toxin formation in coffee and to find a reliable, perfect source of beans that always make you feel great. Upgraded beans are harvested in Central America from passive organic estates without chemicals (herbicides, pesticides, etc.). Each bean is hand-picked by experienced coffee harvesters - skilled people who only pick perfectly ripe berries. When the coffee beans are not carefully hand-harvested, the beans can be mistakenly picked unripe and damaged, which impacts the taste and can possibly affect the way it makes you feel.

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0078229050959,https://www.kroger.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-dark-roast-whole-bean-coffee/0078229050959,2024-09-15T19:35:39.981875-04:00,OK

When he set up shop in Berkeley back in 1966, he transformed America’s expectations of the depth, body, and flavor in our cups. And that pursuit of greatness has never stopped. In 2016 we honored his legacy by taking a bold step ahead. Like Mr. Peet’s pioneering dark roasts, our signature medium roast blend expands the horizon of what coffee can be: vibrant, full-flavored, boldly original, and roasted to medium-bodied perfection. In 2022, we took things further, knowing that many love the smooth and balanced flavor of our most loved medium roast, but want it decaffeinated. If you love Major Dickason’s one-of-a-kind taste, you’ll find a kindred spirit in Big Bang™. This blend is crafted from some of the same premium coffees, as Major Dickason’s, but with a twist, thanks to the heavenly, aromatic citrus of Ethiopian Super Natural. It’s the perfect coffee to honor the man who still inspires us every day.
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's® Decaf Big Bang Decaffeinated Ground 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Medium Roast. Our most loved medium roast. Smooth with a balanced richness. Some have described Alfred Peet as the ""big bang"" of craft coffee—the one who started it all.
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home.
Decaf Done Differently: Every Peet’s® decaf is naturally water processed to remove caffeine—not flavor—before meticulous roasting. And by using the same high-quality coffee beans, you get a decaf that tastes as good as the real thing.

It's taken more than 10 years to identify every step of performance-robbing toxin formation in coffee and to find a reliable, perfect source of beans that always make you feel great. Upgraded beans are harvested in Central America from passive organic estates without chemicals (herbicides, pesticides, etc.). Each bean is hand-picked by experienced coffee harvesters - skilled people who only pick perfectly ripe berries. When the coffee beans are not carefully hand-harvested, the beans can be mistakenly picked unripe and damaged, which impacts the taste and can possibly affect the way it makes you feel.

A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason, brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, ""Major D"" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee.
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend Ground 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Flavorful, robust, full-bodied. Developed by Mr. Peet and his most discerning customer, Major Dickason’s Blend epitomizes the rich, flavorful taste of Peet’s.
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home.
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown.

A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason, brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, ""Major D"" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee.

Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Flavorful, robust, full-bodied. Developed by Mr. Peet and his most discerning customer, Major Dickason’s Blend epitomizes the rich, flavorful taste of Peet’s
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home

A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason, brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, ""Major D"" is just like a relationship with an old friend. We'll always remember it as the story of a customer's passion, an expert's palate, and a shared love of coffee.
Contains One (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend Whole Bean 100% Arabica Coffee
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Flavorful, robust, full-bodied. Developed by Mr. Peet and his most discerning customer, Major Dickason’s Blend epitomizes the rich, flavorful taste of Peet’s
Brewing Methods: Use fine ground coffee for espresso at home. Coarsely ground coffee (consistency of coarse sea salt) can be used to make cold brew or a French press. Use a medium grind (consistency of sand) for drip or a pour over in your Chemex
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet.

Its elegant design brews up to 3 servings (with a total 12-ounce capacity). Perfect for the coffee enthusiast or at-home baristas, it's designed to extract the most flavor from ground coffee and achieve a more flavorful brew without buying expensive machines that hog up precious counter space. Water levels marked on the glass, along with the included coffee scoop, help measure the precise water-to-coffee ratio for the perfect cup every time. Its plunger lid, with a built-in microfilter in the spout, pushes grounds to the bottom of the pot and filters out sediment when pouring fresh-brewed coffee. Simply measure medium-ground coffee directly into the glass (approximately 2 rounded tablespoons per 8-ounces of water, or to desired taste). Pour in a small amount of boiled water, gently stir grounds so they sink, and wait 30 seconds for coffee to 'bloom' in the water so it releases more flavor. After the 30 seconds, pour in the rest of the water. Position the plunger lid inside the pot with the filter just above, and level to, the water line. Allow coffee to brew for 3 to 5 minutes. Once coffee is brewed, slowly plunge the grounds (about 20 seconds) to the bottom of the pot. Grounds will continue to brew at the bottom of the pot and make coffee even stronger. Be sure to pour and enjoy coffee immediately. Made from high borosilicate glass and stainless steel, Aerolatte's French Press Coffee Maker is easy to use and clean. The durable glass beaker easily lifts out from the frame for cleaning. All parts are Proposition 65 compliant and dishwasher safe for easy cleanup. Replacement glass beaker (063R) and mesh filter (063WR) are available.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0503917900130,https://www.kroger.com/p/aerolatte-french-press-coffee-maker/0503917900130,2024-09-15T22:01:31.322045-04:00,OK

To produce this coffee, coffee berries are eaten by the Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries come in contact with proteolytic enzymes, which change the composition of the coffee berries. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts it life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet and therefore the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0079460440082,https://www.kroger.com/p/kaya-kopi-honey-whole-bean-coffee/0079460440082,2024-09-15T22:10:43.803646-04:00,OK

Some have described Alfred Peet as the ""big bang"" of craft coffee, the one who started it all. When he set up shop in Berkeley back in 1966, he transformed America’s expectations of the depth, body, and flavor in our cups. And that pursuit of greatness has never stopped. In 2016, we honored his legacy by taking a bold step ahead. Like Mr. Peet’s pioneering dark roasts, this blend expands the horizon of what coffee can be: vibrant, full-flavored, boldly original, and roasted to medium-bodied perfection. If you love Major Dickason’s one-of-a-kind taste, you’ll find a kindred spirit in Big Bang®. This blend is crafted from some of the same premium coffees as Major Dickason’s but with a twist, thanks to the heavenly, aromatic citrus of Ethiopian Super Natural. It’s the perfect coffee to honor the man who still inspires us every day.
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's Big Bang® Ground 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Medium Roast. Our most loved medium roast. Smooth with a balanced richness. Some have described Alfred Peet as the ""big bang"" of craft coffee—the one who started it all.
Brewing Methods: Our ground coffee is perfectly suited to make drip or a pour over in your Chemex. For other brewing methods - espresso, cold brew, or French press - consider our whole bean coffees and griding at home.

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0079460439993,https://www.kroger.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-light-roast-coffee/0079460439993,2024-09-15T22:58:45.164424-04:00,OK

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0071158359844,https://www.kroger.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-whole-bean-coffee/0071158359844,2024-09-15T23:03:09.229786-04:00,OK

Then to Ethiopia, coffee's birthplace, where unique varieties yield exquisite coffees with delicate aromas. Formerly known as Colombia Luminosa, we approached this bright blend, our first light roast, as we do all our coffees: carefully select the very best beans, then hand roast them in small batches to achieve their utmost flavor.

For our darkest roast, we select only top-quality Arabica coffee from the highest altitudes of prime Latin American growing regions. Beans mature slowly at these altitudes, becoming denser, harder and packed with flavor, perfect for retaining boldness and complexity under the intense heat of a deep roast. Peet's® French Roast is not a coffee for the cautious, but for those who embrace the powerful taste, pronounced smoky overtones, and pleasant bite. This dark, deeply flavorful blend pairs well with cream and sugar, and inspires reactions like this one from John ""Nic"" Nicolini, a Peet's® roaster for over 20 years: ""On a normal day, I cup 50 coffees before 7 a.m. But I always come back to French. You inhale that smoky aroma, and then a subtle sweetness pops out that awakens your taste buds. It’s visceral.""
Contains one (1) 10.5 Ounce Bag of Peet's® French Roast Whole Bean 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Dark Roast. Chocolate truffle, smoke, caramel. The rich coffee character of French Roast comes from a short, intense roast, which not all beans can handle and Peet’s® has perfected.
Brewing Methods: Use fine ground coffee for espresso at home. Coarsely ground coffee (consistency of coarse sea salt) can be used to make cold brew or a French press. Use a medium grind (consistency of sand) for drip or a pour over in your Chemex.
Sourcing With Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s® is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown.

Some have described Alfred Peet as the ""big bang"" of craft coffee, the one who started it all. When he set up shop in Berkeley back in 1966, he transformed America’s expectations of the depth, body, and flavor in our cups. And that pursuit of greatness has never stopped. In 2016, we honored his legacy by taking a bold step ahead. Like Mr. Peet’s® pioneering dark roasts, this blend expands the horizon of what coffee can be: vibrant, full-flavored, boldly original, and roasted to medium-bodied perfection. If you love Major Dickason’s one-of-a-kind taste, you’ll find a kindred spirit in Big Bang. This blend is crafted from some of the same premium coffees as Major Dickason’s but with a twist, thanks to the heavenly, aromatic citrus of Ethiopian Super Natural. It’s the perfect coffee to honor the man who still inspires us every day.
Contains one (1) Box of 32 Peet's® Big Bang Medium Roast Coffee Keurig® K-Cup® Pods - 100% Arabica Coffee.
Flavor and Roast: Medium Roast. Our most loved medium roast. Smooth with a balanced richness. Some have described Alfred Peet as the ""big bang"" of craft coffee—the one who started it all.
Brewing Methods: Peet's® single serve, K-Cup® Pods are compatible with all Keurig® K-Cup® Brewers.
Recyclable: Peet’s® K-Cup® Pods are fully recyclable - peel, compost or dispose grounds & recycle. Check locally, not recycled in many communities.
Sourcing with Impact: The coffee you buy can impact the welfare of the people and planet. Peet’s® is actively engaged in driving positive impact in communities where our coffees are grown.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0078535702578,https://www.kroger.com/p/peet-s-big-bang-k-cup-/0078535702578,2024-09-15T23:39:19.282912-04:00,OK

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume.
Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.
Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.
Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.
Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0078229050957,https://www.kroger.com/p/kaya-kopi-luwak-light-roast-whole-bean-coffee/0078229050957,2024-09-15T23:44:53.222319-04:00,OK
