Without dairy, nuts, or anything artificial, this oat beverage still froths, steams, and bakes like cow's milk. It can be used as a creamer substitute without sacrificing any flavor or creaminess. This non-dairy beverage is a super-sustainable substitute for creamers, frothers, sweeteners, and drink additives.
Try it in coffee or tea, hot or iced, and anywhere you want luscious, lactose-free flavor. Oh, and this barista will always get your name right
We enlisted the help of a world-class barista to ensure Oatsome matches or exceeds the frothing quality of any milk (or milk alternative) on the market. Oatsome makes fantastically frothable rich and creamy lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and more
The rumours are true - anything you can do with milk, you can do with Oatsome. So the next time you're cooking up a storm - or a soup - in the kitchen, go ahead and switch milk for Oatsome. Need inspiration? Our recipes page is here to help","Nutrition Facts

Because stevia leaf extract is 200x sweeter than sugar, we balance the sweetness with erythritol, a sweetener produced by fermentation. Erythritol is also found in fruits like grapes and pears.
