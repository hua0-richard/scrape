The winery offers pinot noir as well as small amounts of pinot gris,pinot blanc and chardonnay. The wines are produced from our three estate vineyards – Foley Family Estate, Doe Ridge Estate, Weathergage Estate and other top sites in the Willamette Valley. Highly acclaimed, The Four Graces wines are hand-crafted in small lots using traditional techniques coupled with the most modern technology in winemaking. The 2021 vintage will be remembered in the Willamette Valley for record setting heat and dry conditions. Mild rain during bloom reduced the yields to slightly below average, but the precipitation helped our vines tolerate the unusually hot and dry summer. Harvest began a few weeks earlier than average, with our first pinot noir coming from the Dundee Hills and Ribbon Ridge AVAs on Septem-ber 12th. Our Doe Ridge and Weathergage Estate Vineyards were close behind and by the end of the month all of our pinot noir was harvested. All of the fruit harvested was very high quality, with ripe and concentrated flavors. The fruit for this wine was sourced from our estate vineyards: Foley Family in the Dundee Hills AVA, Doe Ridge in the Yamhill-Carlton AVA and Weathergage in the Van Duzer Corridor AVA; as well as select sites throughout the Willamette Valley AVA. Additional fruit from the Ribbon Ridge AVA make up the final blend. The 2021 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir showcases a beautiful ruby hue in the glass.

Using top-quality grain, mellowed white oak barrels, and that pristine water, we created an easygoing classic whisky to be enjoyed by all. Canadian Mists's distillery is Canada's oldest continuously owned and operated distillery. The distillery is located in Collingwood, Ontario, at the foot of the Blue Mountain and overlooks Georgian Bay. Barley malt, rye, and corn are all sourced locally in Canada. The grains are ground, mixed with water and then mashed to extract their starches. Enzymes in the ground grain convert the starches to sugar, then this converted mash is sent to the fermenter. Yeast is added and fermentation begins. Sugar is converted to alcohol along with some trace flavor compounds known as congeners. The fermented grain mash is now called a “beer”. This is distilled to separate the alcohol. Exposed to steam, the whisky is vaporized and sent to a condenser. The condensed vapor is now known as “high wine.” This new whisky is mingled with water and steam through two columns, which separate out some of the congeners. The remaining congeners are what gives Canadian Mist its flavor and aroma.

In 2015, two friends who adored wine, but weren't exactly sommeliers, had a brainwave. They saw a gap in market for wines that could jive with active, vibrant lives like yours. So, armed with an entrepreneurial spirit and a thirst for fun, they birthed FitVine. FitVine isn't just a wine. It's a revolution, a fun and audacious answer to the call of all of you who want to raise a glass without sacrificing your hard-earned gains at the gym. Sugar? Nah, don't need it. Sulfites and tannins? Keep 'em low like your last set of reps. Flavor? Oh, it's there alright, strutting its stuff like a runway model at a vino fashion show. At FitVine we believe less is more except when it comes to great taste! We also believe you should know what’s in each glass of wine you drink—from sugar content to calories and everything in between so you can make the best choice for you.

Taylor Fladgate is an area leader in winemaking technology, as one of only three Porto producers to pioneer the development of piston fermenter techniques, called Port Toes, that extract significantly greater flavor and aroma than conventional pump-over fermentation. Fermentation is halted by the addition of grape spirits before all the residual sugar has been fermented, creating a sweet, fortified wine. Individual wines produced in different vintages are aged in 600-liter oak casks for years, over which time they will lose their young, dark purple-black color to gain the distinctive “tawny” hue from which the wine takes its name. As tawnies age, the wines take on increasingly more nutty flavors and become more concentrated as the barrels lose 3% of their volume every year (the “Angels’ Share”) to evaporation. The 20 Year Old Tawny is a blend created using tawnies with an average of 20 years of aging.

The initial intent was to make wines that tasted like the best California had to offer, but were priced so that everyone could enjoy them. Developed strong relationships with the owners and growers of some of the best and most coveted vineyards in Sonoma, working with them to produce wines of depth, purity and balance. In 2013, the refreshing and relaxed Banshee tasting room opened in downtown Healdsburg in the heart of Sonoma County. Our main focus for Pinot Noir is on the cool, rugged, coastal areas of the far Western Sonoma Coast. An exciting, yet friendly wine, bursting at the seams with aromas of dried cherry, earthy peat moss and Redwood forest with notes of hyacinth, sandalwood and confectioners sugar. The flavors combine to create a fruit-driven front palate and very subtle oak influence. The finish is bright, with a nice pop of acidity and flavors of tart raspberry and bramble to create great weight for an excellent food wine, as well as a charming drinking experience by itself.

Acrobat is artfully crafted in the gorgeous hills and valleys of western Oregon, with an eye on sustainable winemaking practices.

Following the nose are flavors of fresh lime, lemon zest, and green apple. These mingle on the mid-palate, rounding out a medium bodied mouthfeel with a refreshing, bright finish. The 2017 vintage was fermented in 100% stainless steel tanks, which were temperature controlled to maximize fruit character. This wine benefited from sur lie aging for 3 months prior to bottling. The 2017 vintage began with a colder than average winter, with multiple snowstorms. Thankfully, Spring saw a return to normal with bud break taking place in April. As Summer approached, the classic warm days and cool nights made for ideal growing conditions without any major heat waves. During the harvest we received less than average rainfall, which allowed for nearly perfect harvesting conditions.

Though the first few centuries yielded a beverage quite unlike that of today, years of experience perfected brewing techniques and increased sake's overall appeal and popularity. In 1905, the brand name GEKKEIKAN (meaning ""crown of laurel"") was adopted as the company's formal pledge to excellence. Through this commitment, the company became a true leader in the industry and pioneered a number of research and development efforts. The successful results of these endeavors have enabled Gekkeikan to become one of the nation's most popular brands. Gekkeikan's passion for pleasing the sake connoisseur remains unchanged.

Aromas of white fruits, citrus and light floral notes. An ideal Cava to start a meal. It also pairs well with preserved seafood, (clams, winkles, and anchovies), pasta dishes with seafood sprinkled with arbequina extra virgin olive oil or a warm quail salad.

Due to its especially high rye content, Bulleit Bourbon has a bold, spicy character with a finish that's distinctively clean and smooth. Medium amber in color, with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas, the mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak, and nutmeg. The finish is long, dry, and satiny with a light-tasting toffee flavor that lingers long after the final sip. Simply combine our bourbon whiskey with cloves, lemon juice, brown sugar and hot water for a comforting Hot Toddy. Bulleit Bourbon earned a gold medal at the 2021 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Includes one 90 proof 1.75 L bottle of Bourbon Whiskey. Please drink responsibly.

Pedro's nickname was ""El Freixenet"", named after his family's ranch ""La Freixeneda"", which means ash tree grove in Catalan. Dolores' keen interest in the winemaking process was easily complemented by Pedro's business savvy and sense of community. Their marriage coincided with the arrival of the Phylloxera plague in Spain, which wiped out most of Europe's vineyards. Far from being deterred, the couple replanted their decimated land with white varietals to make sparkling wine. In 1914, the first bottles were released with Pedro's childhood nickname on the label. Freixenet had been born. Freixenet Alcohol-Free White is a non-alcoholic white wine that offers a refreshing and light experience. It presents a pale straw-yellow color and releases delicate aromas of citrus fruits and white flowers. On the palate, it delivers a crisp and zesty character, with flavors of green apple, lemon, and a touch of tropical notes. The lively acidity and clean finish make Freixenet Alcohol-Free White a perfect choice for those seeking a non-alcoholic alternative that still captures the essence of a white wine.

In 1729, he arrived in Portugal and became a partner in the export company, Messrs. Clark, Thornton & Warre, which exported Portuguese wine among other goods. By the close of the 18th century, Warre's had become one of the leading companies in the Port wine trade. His grandson, another William Warre, continued and grew the business, contributing substantially towards the recovery of Portugal's independence. The Symington family's ancestry in the Port trade spans a period of over 350 years, through 13 generations. They are descended from Andrew James Symington and Beatrice Atkinson who were married in Oporto in 1891. Andrew James arrived as a young man from Scotland in 1882 and was admitted to partnership in the firm of Warre & Co. in 1905 and in 1908 he became the soul owner of Warre & Co. Currently six members of the Symington family are actively involved in Warre's day-to-day management, with the dedication and long-term commitment that are unique to a family-run business. From the vineyards through the winemaking, aging, and blending, a member of the family is directly responsible for every bottle of Warre's Port produced. The family's commitment to its wines, and to making them sustainably, is stronger than ever after 350 years, an unparalleled tradition in the Port trade.

Only ingredients of the very highest quality are used. The complexity of Bulleit Bourbon comes from its unique blend of rye, corn, and barley malt, along with special strains of yeast and pure Kentucky limestone-filtered water. Due to its especially high rye content, Bulleit Bourbon has a bold, spicy character with a finish that's distinctively clean and smooth. Medium amber in color, with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas, the mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak, and nutmeg. The finish is long, dry, and satiny with a light-tasting toffee flavor that lingers long after the final sip. Simply combine our bourbon whiskey with cloves, lemon juice, brown sugar and hot water for a comforting Hot Toddy. Bulleit Bourbon earned a gold medal at the 2021 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Includes one 90 proof 750 mL bottle of Bourbon Whiskey. Please drink responsibly.

Using top-quality grain, mellowed white oak barrels, and that pristine water, we created an easygoing classic whisky to be enjoyed by all. Canadian Mists's distillery is Canada's oldest continuously owned and operated distillery. The distillery is located in Collingwood, Ontario, at the foot of the Blue Mountain and overlooks Georgian Bay. Barley malt, rye, and corn are all sourced locally in Canada. The grains are ground, mixed with water and then mashed to extract their starches. Enzymes in the ground grain convert the starches to sugar, then this converted mash is sent to the fermenter. Yeast is added and fermentation begins. Sugar is converted to alcohol along with some trace flavor compounds known as congeners. The fermented grain mash is now called a “beer”. This is distilled to separate the alcohol. Exposed to steam, the whisky is vaporized and sent to a condenser. The condensed vapor is now known as “high wine.” This new whisky is mingled with water and steam through two columns, which separate out some of the congeners. The remaining congeners are what gives Canadian Mist its flavor and aroma.

Taylor Fladgate is an area leader in winemaking technology, as one of only three Porto producers to pioneer the development of piston fermenter techniques, called Port Toes, that extract significantly greater flavor and aroma than conventional pump-over fermentation. Fermentation is halted by the addition of grape spirits before all the residual sugar has been fermented, creating a sweet, fortified wine. Individual wines produced in different vintages are aged in 600-liter oak casks for years, over which time they will lose their young, dark purple-black color to gain the distinctive “tawny” hue from which the wine takes its name. As tawnies age, the wines take on increasingly more nutty flavors and become more concentrated as the barrels lose 3% of their volume every year (the “Angels’ Share”) to evaporation. The 20 Year Old Tawny is a blend created using tawnies with an average of 20 years of aging.

In 1729, he arrived in Portugal and became a partner in the export company, Messrs. Clark, Thornton & Warre, which exported Portuguese wine among other goods. By the close of the 18th century, Warre's had become one of the leading companies in the Port wine trade. His grandson, another William Warre, continued and grew the business, contributing substantially towards the recovery of Portugal's independence. The Symington family's ancestry in the Port trade spans a period of over 350 years, through 13 generations. They are descended from Andrew James Symington and Beatrice Atkinson who were married in Oporto in 1891. Andrew James arrived as a young man from Scotland in 1882 and was admitted to partnership in the firm of Warre & Co. in 1905 and in 1908 he became the soul owner of Warre & Co. Currently six members of the Symington family are actively involved in Warre's day-to-day management, with the dedication and long-term commitment that are unique to a family-run business. From the vineyards through the winemaking, aging, and blending, a member of the family is directly responsible for every bottle of Warre's Port produced. The family's commitment to its wines, and to making them sustainably, is stronger than ever after 350 years, an unparalleled tradition in the Port trade.

The winery offers pinot noir as well as small amounts of pinot gris,pinot blanc and chardonnay. The wines are produced from our three estate vineyards – Foley Family Estate, Doe Ridge Estate, Weathergage Estate and other top sites in the Willamette Valley. Highly acclaimed, The Four Graces wines are hand-crafted in small lots using traditional techniques coupled with the most modern technology in winemaking. The 2021 vintage will be remembered in the Willamette Valley for record setting heat and dry conditions. Mild rain during bloom reduced the yields to slightly below average, but the precipitation helped our vines tolerate the unusually hot and dry summer. Harvest began a few weeks earlier than average, with our first pinot noir coming from the Dundee Hills and Ribbon Ridge AVAs on Septem-ber 12th. Our Doe Ridge and Weathergage Estate Vineyards were close behind and by the end of the month all of our pinot noir was harvested. All of the fruit harvested was very high quality, with ripe and concentrated flavors. The fruit for this wine was sourced from our estate vineyards: Foley Family in the Dundee Hills AVA, Doe Ridge in the Yamhill-Carlton AVA and Weathergage in the Van Duzer Corridor AVA; as well as select sites throughout the Willamette Valley AVA. Additional fruit from the Ribbon Ridge AVA make up the final blend. The 2021 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir showcases a beautiful ruby hue in the glass.

The initial intent was to make wines that tasted like the best California had to offer, but were priced so that everyone could enjoy them. Developed strong relationships with the owners and growers of some of the best and most coveted vineyards in Sonoma, working with them to produce wines of depth, purity and balance. In 2013, the refreshing and relaxed Banshee tasting room opened in downtown Healdsburg in the heart of Sonoma County. Our main focus for Pinot Noir is on the cool, rugged, coastal areas of the far Western Sonoma Coast. An exciting, yet friendly wine, bursting at the seams with aromas of dried cherry, earthy peat moss and Redwood forest with notes of hyacinth, sandalwood and confectioners sugar. The flavors combine to create a fruit-driven front palate and very subtle oak influence.

In 1889, Pedro Ferrer married Dolores Sala, whose family had been making wine at their Casa Sala property since 1861. Pedro's nickname was ""El Freixenet"", named after his family's ranch ""La Freixeneda"", which means ash tree grove in Catalan. Dolores' keen interest in the winemaking process was easily complemented by Pedro's business savvy and sense of community. Their marriage coincided with the arrival of the Phylloxera plague in Spain, which wiped out most of Europe's vineyards. Far from being deterred, the couple replanted their decimated land with white varietals to make sparkling wine. In 1914, the first bottles were released with Pedro's childhood nickname on the label. Freixenet had been born. Freixenet Alcohol-Free White is a non-alcoholic white wine that offers a refreshing and light experience. It presents a pale straw-yellow color and releases delicate aromas of citrus fruits and white flowers. On the palate, it delivers a crisp and zesty character, with flavors of green apple, lemon, and a touch of tropical notes. The lively acidity and clean finish make Freixenet Alcohol-Free White a perfect choice for those seeking a non-alcoholic alternative that still captures the essence of a white wine.

Rumor has it some of those grapes might have been used to make wine. For those that dared to toil in the black market of winemaking, bold, full-bodied wines were a crowd favorite at speakeasies across the country. That same rebellious 1920s spirit lives on in our daring wines - and in those who drink them. So, as you pour your next glass and make mischief of your own, 1924 will be there every sip of the way.

Only ingredients of the very highest quality are used. The complexity of Bulleit Bourbon comes from its unique blend of rye, corn, and barley malt, along with special strains of yeast and pure Kentucky limestone-filtered water. Due to its especially high rye content, Bulleit Bourbon has a bold, spicy character with a finish that's distinctively clean and smooth. Medium amber in color, with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas, the mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak, and nutmeg. The finish is long, dry, and satiny with a light-tasting toffee flavor that lingers long after the final sip. Simply combine our bourbon whiskey with cloves, lemon juice, brown sugar and hot water for a comforting Hot Toddy. Bulleit Bourbon earned a gold medal at the 2021 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Includes one 90 proof 750 mL bottle of Bourbon Whiskey. Please drink responsibly.

At the heart of these wines is the love of pairing an honest wine with casual meals and gatherings. Acrobat should always be an effortless selection – a wine that consistently pairs in every way with our lives. Acrobat is artfully crafted in the gorgeous hills and valleys of western Oregon, with an eye on sustainable winemaking practices. A light-gold hue in color, the 2017 Acrobat Pinot Gris shines through with bright, crisp flavors. Rose petal elements on the nose highlight balanced citrus components of lemon and grapefruit. Following the nose are flavors of fresh lime, lemon zest, and green apple. These mingle on the mid-palate, rounding out a medium bodied mouthfeel with a refreshing, bright finish. The 2017 vintage was fermented in 100% stainless steel tanks, which were temperature controlled to maximize fruit character. This wine benefited from sur lie aging for 3 months prior to bottling. The 2017 vintage began with a colder than average winter, with multiple snowstorms. Thankfully, Spring saw a return to normal with bud break taking place in April. As Summer approached, the classic warm days and cool nights made for ideal growing conditions without any major heat waves. During the harvest we received less than average rainfall, which allowed for nearly perfect harvesting conditions.

This wine honors their brave contributions with a bold and tasty red blend.

Brimming with the vibrancy of fresh fruit flavors, Morning Fog Chardonnay showcases the subtle interplay between the succulent notes of apple and the comforting warmth of graham cracker, all delicately framed by the nuanced infusion of toasty oak derived from a precise barrel-aging process. This Chardonnay is a versatile white wine, meticulously barrel-aged to achieve a harmony that complements a diverse range of dishes, from the ocean's bounty to the rustic charm of grilled chicken and the simplicity of light pasta fare. It's the perfect partner to food, conversation, and cherished moments.
