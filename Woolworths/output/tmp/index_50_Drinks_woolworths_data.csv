A bit about Remedy
Remedy was founded by Sarah and Emmet Condon in 2012. They started brewing kombucha at home, noticing that many drinks in supermarkets were either unhealthy, falsely marketed as healthy, or healthy but unpalatable. Their solution? Creating a tasty drink that's genuinely good for you. They believed healthy didn't have to mean boring and launched Remedy with this ethos.","Nutrition Information

A bit about Schweppes:
Their story began in 1783 when Jacob Schweppe brought 'Schweppervescence' to life. He perfected the way of capturing and bottling bubbles (the process of carbonation) - and founded Schweppes in Geneva. Today, Schweppes continues to create quality sparkling beverages, with recipes masterfully crafted with over 235 years of expertise.

A bit about Remedy
Remedy was founded by Sarah and Emmet Condon in 2012. They started brewing kombucha at home, noticing that many drinks in supermarkets were either unhealthy, falsely marketed as healthy, or healthy but unpalatable. Their solution? Creating a tasty drink that's genuinely good for you. They believed healthy didn't have to mean boring and launched Remedy with this ethos.","Nutrition Information

We are excited to offer Tea Gardens Hemp Kombucha. This delicious Hemp Kombucha is loaded with probiotics, enzymes, and antioxidants, combined with the benefits of hemp seed and is totally sugar free!
Functional beverages are unique because they offer more than just hydration; they offer additional health benefits. Kombucha is a functional beverage that is made by fermenting tea. The fermentation process creates beneficial probiotics, which are live bacteria that are good for gut health. Kombucha is also rich in antioxidants, which can help protect cells from damage and support a healthy immune system.
Our Hemp Kombucha is locally brewed, light and refreshing, but also has all of the benefits that kombucha is known for: boosting immunity, aiding digestion and assisting with overall gut health.
Tea Gardens Hemp Kombucha is the perfect drink for those who are looking to improve their health and wellbeing whilst enjoying a delicious and tasty drink.  Tea Gardens Hemp Kombucha is the best tasting, best value Kombucha in Australia.
Many people think of Kombucha as a fad, but did you know that it's been widely used for over 2000 years because of its detoxifying and energising properties? Kombucha has experienced a recent resurgence in the health drinks industry, putting it back in the spotlight. In the wake of growing awareness of what we eat and the benefits of fermented foods and beverages, there is growing interest in kombucha's health benefits.
The Health Benefits of Kombucha
Kombucha has many potential health benefits, including gut health, weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels. Probiotics are live bacteria created during the fermentation process of making kombucha that are good for gut health. These probiotics can help improve digestion and reduce inflammation. Kombucha is also low in calories and sugar, making it a great choice for those looking to lose weight or manage their blood sugar levels. Additionally, kombucha contains acetic acid, which has been shown to lower cholesterol levels.
How to Incorporate Kombucha Into Your Diet
If you're new to kombucha, start with a small amount to see how your body reacts.  Some people may initially experience gastrointestinal issues, but as your gut health improves, these issues disappear. If you're looking for ways to incorporate kombucha into your diet, other than enjoying it as a chilled beverage straight from the bottle, then try adding it to sparkling water or tea, or using it as a marinade in recipes.
Whilst you can find kombucha in many stores now - just make sure to check the label for added sugars. Tea Gardens Kombucha is sugar free.

A bit about the brand/more info:
Remedy was founded by Sarah and Emmet Condon in 2012. They started brewing kombucha at home, noticing that many drinks in supermarkets were either unhealthy, falsely marketed as healthy, or healthy but unpalatable. Their solution? Creating a tasty drink that's genuinely good for you. They believed healthy didn't have to mean boring and launched Remedy with this ethos.

We are excited to offer Tea Gardens Hemp Kombucha. This delicious Hemp Kombucha is loaded with probiotics, enzymes, and antioxidants, combined with the benefits of hemp seed and is totally sugar free!
Functional beverages are unique because they offer more than just hydration; they offer additional health benefits. Kombucha is a functional beverage that is made by fermenting tea. The fermentation process creates beneficial probiotics, which are live bacteria that are good for gut health. Kombucha is also rich in antioxidants, which can help protect cells from damage and support a healthy immune system.
Our Hemp Kombucha is locally brewed, light and refreshing, but also has all of the benefits that kombucha is known for: boosting immunity, aiding digestion and assisting with overall gut health.
Tea Gardens Hemp Kombucha is the perfect drink for those who are looking to improve their health and wellbeing whilst enjoying a delicious and tasty drink.  Tea Gardens Hemp Kombucha is the best tasting, best value Kombucha in Australia.
Many people think of Kombucha as a fad, but did you know that it's been widely used for over 2000 years because of its detoxifying and energising properties? Kombucha has experienced a recent resurgence in the health drinks industry, putting it back in the spotlight. In the wake of growing awareness of what we eat and the benefits of fermented foods and beverages, there is growing interest in kombucha's health benefits.
The Health Benefits of Kombucha
Kombucha has many potential health benefits, including gut health, weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels. Probiotics are live bacteria created during the fermentation process of making kombucha that are good for gut health. These probiotics can help improve digestion and reduce inflammation. Kombucha is also low in calories and sugar, making it a great choice for those looking to lose weight or manage their blood sugar levels. Additionally, kombucha contains acetic acid, which has been shown to lower cholesterol levels.
How to Incorporate Kombucha Into Your Diet
If you're new to kombucha, start with a small amount to see how your body reacts.  Some people may initially experience gastrointestinal issues, but as your gut health improves, these issues disappear. If you're looking for ways to incorporate kombucha into your diet, other than enjoying it as a chilled beverage straight from the bottle, then try adding it to sparkling water or tea, or using it as a marinade in recipes.
Whilst you can find kombucha in many stores now - just make sure to check the label for added sugars. Tea Gardens Kombucha is sugar free.

A bit about Remedy
Remedy was founded by Sarah and Emmet Condon in 2012. They started brewing kombucha at home, noticing that many drinks in supermarkets were either unhealthy, falsely marketed as healthy, or healthy but unpalatable. Their solution? Creating a tasty drink that's genuinely good for you. They believed healthy didn't have to mean boring and launched Remedy with this ethos.","Nutrition Information

Combining his life-long fascination with the chemistry of aerated waters with his entrepreneurial spirit, a 27-year-old George Saxby established his first drinks factory at Chatham, just near Taree in 1864. Named George Saxby, Manning River, the factory was created to brew his now famous Stone Ginger Beer in large wooden casks, before being packaged in ceramic bottles, which where filled and corked by hand. The story of Saxbys is as unique and refreshing as the taste of our renowned stone ginger beer.","Nutrition Information

Functional beverages are unique because they offer more than just hydration; they offer additional health benefits. Kombucha is a functional beverage that is made by fermenting tea.

Many people think of Kombucha as a fad, but did you know that it's been widely used for over 2000 years because of its detoxifying and energising properties? Kombucha has experienced a recent resurgence in the health drinks industry, putting it back in the spotlight. In the wake of growing awareness of what we eat and the benefits of fermented foods and beverages, there is growing interest in kombucha's health benefits.
The Health Benefits of Kombucha
Kombucha has many potential health benefits, including gut health, weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels. Probiotics are live bacteria created during the fermentation process of making kombucha that are good for gut health. These probiotics can help improve digestion and reduce inflammation. Kombucha is also low in calories and sugar, making it a great choice for those looking to lose weight or manage their blood sugar levels. Additionally, kombucha contains acetic acid, which has been shown to lower cholesterol levels.
How to Incorporate Kombucha Into Your Diet
If you're new to kombucha, start with a small amount to see how your body reacts.  Some people may initially experience gastrointestinal issues, but as your gut health improves, these issues disappear. If you're looking for ways to incorporate kombucha into your diet, other than enjoying it as a chilled beverage straight from the bottle, then try adding it to sparkling water or tea, or using it as a marinade in recipes.
Whilst you can find kombucha in many stores now - just make sure to check the label for added sugars. Tea Gardens Kombucha is sugar free.

A bit about Remedy
Remedy was founded by Sarah and Emmet Condon in 2012. They started brewing kombucha at home, noticing that many drinks in supermarkets were either unhealthy, falsely marketed as healthy, or healthy but unpalatable. Their solution? Creating a tasty drink that's genuinely good for you. They believed healthy didn't have to mean boring and launched Remedy with this ethos.","Nutrition Information

A bit about the brand/more info:
Combining his life-long fascination with the chemistry of aerated waters with his entrepreneurial spirit, a 27-year-old George Saxby established his first drinks factory at Chatham, just near Taree in 1864. Named George Saxby, Manning River, the factory was created to brew his now famous Stone Ginger Beer in large wooden casks, before being packaged in ceramic bottles, which where filled and corked by hand. The story of Saxbys is as unique and refreshing as the taste of our renowned stone ginger beer.","Nutrition Information

Ingredients: filtered sparkling water, natural plant extracts, (native quandong, red beet, gardenia, monk fruit) natural flavour, citric acid.
Tasting Notes:
Clear and bright in the glass with a delicate foam mousse as poured that dissipates leaving gentle fine bubbles.⁠⁠The nose offers such fruit driven purity, showing all things orange - zest, peel, mandarin, tangerine and lovely white peach.⁠⁠The palate is dry and ever so slightly effervescent with a hint of extra mid palate character, almost cantaloupe just ripening.⁠ Refreshing, bright and fresh.

Be ready for any social occasion, you can have all the flavours of East Forged - COLD BREW NITRO TEA
Australian Black Tea & Yuzu - a modern twist on a classic iced black tea & lemon 
Bright Yuzu citrus aroma with the taste of Australian-grown black tea. It has a light body, low acidity and creamy froth mouthfeel. Carefully cold brewed to perfection without the bitterness that is found in hot black tea.
Australian Green Tea & Pitaya - shaking up green tea with pink power 
Fresh, sweet and a little tangy with notes of kiwi fruit and lychee. The Australian-grown sencha green tea taste is carefully complemented with pitaya, commonly known as red dragonfruit.
White Tea & Calamansi - take a walk in a jasmine tea garden 
This is our most aromatic flavour. The orange/lime citrus aroma of Calamansi is distinctive against the grassy and hay taste of the white tea. The perfect thirst-quenching drink on a hot summer day.

Voss water source in Norway has been naturally protected from pollutants for centuries. Voss water is not filtered or treated, its unprocessed nature and naturally low presence of total dissolved solids (TDS) give it a fresh, clean taste.
VOSS quickly became known and admired for its sleek, beautiful exterior, making it perhaps the most iconic and recognizable water bottle ever. But that beauty on the outside has always reflected the beauty of what is on the inside of every bottle. Voss bottled water is taken from a virgin aquifer that has been shielded for centuries under ice and rock in the untouched wilderness of Central Norway.
This bulk box is great for keeping at home for when you need to drink Voss on the go and the wider mouth is perfect for adding fruit to the bottles.","Nutrition Information

Store in a cool, dry place. or cold temperature A bit about the brand/more info: Evian natural spring water is a product of nature. We never add things for taste or enhance with extras. Evian water starts as rain and snow in the peaks of the French Alps which is then deposited on our watershed, a unique geological landscape surrounded by mountains and glaciers. evian water travels on a 15 year journey to the source through layers of glacial rocks which naturally protect the water from outside pollution and enrich it with naturally occurring electrolytes and minerals, which provide the distinctive, crisp taste. Evian water emerges at the Source Cachat in small French town of Evian-les-Bains.

A bit about the brand/more info
Once upon a time, nestled among the enchanting hills of Italy, lay the picturesque town of Apecchio. Known for its idyllic charm and rich history, Apecchio was blessed with a magical bridge that spanned the gentle river flowing through the heart of the city. Legend had it that this ancient bridge held the key to the city's prosperity. For centuries, the citizens believed that the bridge possessed a mystical power bestowed upon it by the benevolent spirits of the land. It was said that those who crossed the bridge with pure intentions would be granted a special gift. The bridge stood tall and proud, its sturdy stones weathered by time. Its arches gracefully reached towards the heavens, as if inviting visitors to tread upon its sacred path. Every day, people from all over the world would gather at the bridge, eager to experience its wonders. But it wasn't just the bridge that held secrets within Apecchio. Nestled nearby, hidden amidst the lush vegetation, there was a natural spring that the locals called ""The Fountain of Life."" The spring water was believed to possess healing properties, capable of rejuvenating both the body and the soul. It was said that those who drank from its source would be blessed with good health and vitality. Generations of Apecchio's inhabitants cherished the spring's water, considering it a precious gift from nature. They would fill jugs and bottles, bringing the water home to share with their loved ones. The pure and crystalline liquid became an integral part of their daily lives. The city of Apecchio and its extraordinary wonders would forever occupy a special place in the hearts of all who encountered them. This is the story of San D'Aqua.

A bit about the brand/more info
Once upon a time, nestled among the enchanting hills of Italy, lay the picturesque town of Apecchio. Known for its idyllic charm and rich history, Apecchio was blessed with a magical bridge that spanned the gentle river flowing through the heart of the city. Legend had it that this ancient bridge held the key to the city's prosperity. For centuries, the citizens believed that the bridge possessed a mystical power bestowed upon it by the benevolent spirits of the land. It was said that those who crossed the bridge with pure intentions would be granted a special gift. The bridge stood tall and proud, its sturdy stones weathered by time. Its arches gracefully reached towards the heavens, as if inviting visitors to tread upon its sacred path. Every day, people from all over the world would gather at the bridge, eager to experience its wonders. But it wasn't just the bridge that held secrets within Apecchio. Nestled nearby, hidden amidst the lush vegetation, there was a natural spring that the locals called ""The Fountain of Life."" The spring water was believed to possess healing properties, capable of rejuvenating both the body and the soul. It was said that those who drank from its source would be blessed with good health and vitality. Generations of Apecchio's inhabitants cherished the spring's water, considering it a precious gift from nature. They would fill jugs and bottles, bringing the water home to share with their loved ones. The pure and crystalline liquid became an integral part of their daily lives. The city of Apecchio and its extraordinary wonders would forever occupy a special place in the hearts of all who encountered them. This is the story of San D'Aqua.

A bit about the brand/more info:
Deep in Gator Country a legend was made back in 1965. Plagued by heat, the University of Florida football players fell victim to one of the most devastating competitors ever - dehydration. Something revealed when players never had to use the 'facilities' during games. University of Florida doctors discovered that the players weren't properly hydrated, causing their performance to falter. The researchers - Dr. Robert Cade, Dr. Dana Shires, Dr. H. James Free and Dr. Alejandro de Quesada, formulated a new carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage that, unlike water, kept the players properly hydrated. The Gators went 7-4 that year, 9-2 in 1966 then went on to win the Orange Bowl for the first time.

A bit about the brand/more info:
Deep in Gator Country a legend was made back in 1965. Plagued by heat, the University of Florida football players fell victim to one of the most devastating competitors ever - dehydration. Something revealed when players never had to use the 'facilities' during games. University of Florida doctors discovered that the players weren't properly hydrated, causing their performance to falter. The researchers - Dr. Robert Cade, Dr. Dana Shires, Dr. H. James Free and Dr. Alejandro de Quesada, formulated a new carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage that, unlike water, kept the players properly hydrated. The Gators went 7-4 that year, 9-2 in 1966 then went on to win the Orange Bowl for the first time.

A bit about the brand/more info:
Deep in Gator Country a legend was made back in 1965. Plagued by heat, the University of Florida football players fell victim to one of the most devastating competitors ever - dehydration. Something revealed when players never had to use the 'facilities' during games. University of Florida doctors discovered that the players weren't properly hydrated, causing their performance to falter. The researchers - Dr. Robert Cade, Dr. Dana Shires, Dr. H. James Free and Dr. Alejandro de Quesada, formulated a new carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage that, unlike water, kept the players properly hydrated. The Gators went 7-4 that year, 9-2 in 1966 then went on to win the Orange Bowl for the first time.

A bit about the brand/more info:
Deep in Gator Country a legend was made back in 1965. Plagued by heat, the University of Florida football players fell victim to one of the most devastating competitors ever - dehydration. Something revealed when players never had to use the'facilities' during games. University of Florida doctors discovered that the players weren't properly hydrated, causing their performance to falter. The researchers - Dr. Robert Cade, Dr. Dana Shires, Dr. H. James Free and Dr. Alejandro de Quesada, formulated a new carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage that, unlike water, kept the players properly hydrated. The Gators went 7-4 that year, 9-2 in 1966 then went on to win the Orange Bowl for the first time.

Sometimes you just need a Decaf moment to find your Zen.Retreat with this full-flavoured cuppa and politely tell caffeine it's not welcome. Wait. What's that? Right. Apparently we must inform you each bag contains less than 0.3% caffeine. So it's 99.7% not welcome.Some people don't quite get the whole ""just give me five minutes to enjoy this cuppa in peace"" situation. Not to worry. Our new tea bag tags double as 'Do Not Disturb' messages. Leave one on the counter, hang it on a doorknob, or hand them out to repeat interrupters.In 1837, two brothers decided to stir up the tea industry, by horse. Really. Each morning for 19 years Joseph and Edward Tetley loaded a packhorse with their finest tea and peddled it until the Yorkshire sun set. How did they (and the horse) do it for so long? We have no idea.Finally they set up shop in London. The horse was gone but the Tetley spirit remained: one part pragmatic attitude, an equal measure of working class roots and a generous spoonful of 'stiff upper lip'.There you have it. An almost-200-ish year history we're quite proud of.","Nutrition Information

This rooibos (also known as redbush) is grown on a small organic farm amongst the clean air and pure water streams of the Cedarberg Mountains, in South Africa the same way it has been for centuries. It is then hand harvested and left to dry in the sun, the same way the Khoisan people have done it for millennia.
When cut and fermented, the leaves of the Rooibos plant turn a rich orangey- red colour, and it is this distinctive colour which led to the Afrikaans name rooibos meaning red bush.

Our rooibos tea has a lot to offer. Not only does it taste deliciously sweet and earthy, it also full of natural goodness. Rooibos can be enjoyed with or without milk, making it the perfect naturally caffeine free alternative to black tea.","Nutrition Information

At the heart of Arkadia lies the story of a family. Born out of Melbourne's famous café culture, our story begins in 1997 when Greg, Anna and their two sons Roman and Jack create a delicious drinking chocolate for their local café. In the years since, the Arkadia range of drinking chocolates, chai teas, frappes and syrups has won devoted fans in cafes, restaurants and homes around Australia and the world.
We believe great tasting beverages that can be enjoyed and shared with friends is an  indulgence we all deserve. We trust you'll enjoy your ""Arkadia moment"" as much as we have enjoyed bringing it to you.","Nutrition Information
