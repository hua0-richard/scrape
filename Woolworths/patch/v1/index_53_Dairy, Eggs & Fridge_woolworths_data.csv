An increased amount of cream in the finished cheese makes for a well-balanced acidity and decadent texture, perfect to serve with Maggie's Quince or Spiced Pear Paste.Maggie's tips for a perfect platter:1. Take your soft cheeses out of the fridge early enough to ensure the soft cheese is room temperature when serving. By allowing your soft cheese to reach room temperature, you will receive that deliciously gooey consistency we all adore. Keep an eye on the weather - as if it is a hot day, this process won't take long!2. Include a nice hard cheese like an aged and deliciously crumbly Cheddar and break some of it into bite-sized chunks 3. Put a fruit paste such as Quince Paste or Quince & Champagne Paste onto your board or platter so guests can pair the paste with the selection of cheese4. Tear chunks of a crusty sourdough baguette and heap onto your board with crackers, roasted almonds and dried pears for guests to nibble on.5. If you are serving a pate, remove it from the fridge at the last minute and serve the pot in an ice bath to ensure it stays beautifully chilled. All that's left is to open a bottle of your favourite wine or non-alcoholic, sit back and enjoy!  - Australian owned- Australian made- 100% Australian milk & cream","Nutrition Information

Surface ripened, it is a rich example of a classic Camembert, and teams beautifully with Maggie Beer's Cabernet Paste or Plum Paste.Maggie's tips for a perfect platter:1. Take your soft cheeses out of the fridge early enough to ensure the soft cheese is room temperature when serving. By allowing your soft cheese to reach room temperature, you will receive that deliciously gooey consistency we all adore. Keep an eye on the weather - as if it is a hot day, this process won't take long!2. Include a nice hard cheese like an aged and deliciously crumbly Cheddar and break some of it into bite-sized chunks 3. Put a fruit paste such as Quince Paste or Quince & Champagne Paste onto your board or platter so guests can pair the paste with the selection of cheese4. Tear chunks of a crusty sourdough baguette and heap onto your board with crackers, roasted almonds and dried pears for guests to nibble on.5. If you are serving a pate, remove it from the fridge at the last minute and serve the pot in an ice bath to ensure it stays beautifully chilled. All that's left is to open a bottle of your favourite wine or non-alcoholic, sit back and enjoy!  - Australian owned- Australian made- 100% Australian milk & cream","Nutrition Information

It is a delicate shell of fresh mozzarella that encases stracciatella. It is a special moment of anticipation for your dinner guests when you press the knife into your Burrata to release the stracciatella from inside the heart of its mozzarella casing. The little shreds of mozzarella that makes up the stracciatella combines with the rich cream to become as soft and milky as it is decadent. It doesn’t matter how you serve it. You can break it over bread, you can break it over a pizza, you can break it over a bed of tomatoes or a salad of roasted vegetables. Whatever way you choose, season it with a little salt, pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. But keep your recipes simple because the burrata is the hero.","Nutrition Information

Mozzarella, also from the Pasta Filata family, is lower in moisture than Bocconcini. La Casa Del Formaggio's Mozzarella follows the same manufacturing process as the Bocconcini products, only it is cooked a little longer in its own whey to expel more moisture, making it one of the purest Mozzarellas on the market, with absolutely no artificial preservatives. Our Mozzarella is higher moisture than standard pizza cheese, which means it stays rich and creamy when melted at high temperatures.","Nutrition Information

It also works well in cheesecakes, pies, tarts and other sweet dishes.

Traditional Ricotta is soft and creamy with a delicate texture and pleasant slight caramel flavour. During the cheese making process, milk is set and then cut separating the curd and whey. The curd is further processed to manufacture cheeses such Bocconcini, Fresh Pecorino and Mozzarella, while the whey is used to produce the Ricotta. Extra milk is added to the whey in order to increase the creamy characteristics of this full cream Traditional Ricotta. The name Ricotta translated from Italian means ‘recooked’, thus being the case with the whey.

As the packaging strains the whey expelled by this ricotta, the result is a firmer ricotta than our tub variations. This makes it ideal for cooking at higher temperatures as it will not release as much moisture when exposed to high temperatures in the cooking process.","Nutrition Information

What they are is fully foamable putting you in total control over the density and performance of your foam so you can showcase your latte art skillz, sorry, we mean skills.You should probably give it a try and see what you think.

If you don’t happen to be a barista, that’s cool. Just heat this Barista Edition oat milk in a container while giving it a whirl until it foams up nicely and then pour yourself an oat latte. And if you don't feel like a latte you will be happy to know that this product tastes just as amazing if you drink it straight or pour it on your granola or put it to work with your cooking skills. But let's keep that to us non-baristas, okay?

100% cool for vegans. Free from dairy and soy.","Nutrition Information

What they are is fully foamable putting you in total control over the density and performance of your foam so you can showcase your latte art skillz, sorry, we mean skills.You should probably give it a try and see what you think.

If you don’t happen to be a barista, that’s cool. Just heat this Barista Edition oat milk in a container while giving it a whirl until it foams up nicely and then pour yourself an oat latte. And if you don't feel like a latte you will be happy to know that this product tastes just as amazing if you drink it straight or pour it on your granola or put it to work with your cooking skills. But let's keep that to us non-baristas, okay?

Putting Australian specialty coffee on the map, we have travelled to the Atherton Tablelands region in far North Queensland, where the high altitude mountainous region makes for the perfect coffee terroir. Similarly to the local hunter of the region, our Australian crocodiles, who stalk and snatch their prey, that’s how we feel about choosing the right coffee bean – single minded in the pursuit of the perfect brew. Locally roasted and ground, we slowly brew and triple filter our coffee for maximum flavour extraction. Finally we cut the brew with fresh full cream milk and nothing else. The result is notes of macadamia and mandarin with a milk chocolate finish.","Nutrition Information

We’ve hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cerrado region of Brazil where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has nutty and bright citrus notes, with a caramel finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cerrado coffee beans are informed by the region’s special terroir.
With rich soils and high altitudes, Cerrado produces a clean bean that translates into a well-balanced coffee in body and acidity.
The region’s moderate continental climate adds to a robust growing season, which is reflected in our Hunt and Brew Brazil blend.

Our hunt has taken us to La Union in the Nariño region of Colombia where the high altitude, soil and climate conditions produce a soft brew that has citrus and sweet notes, with a smoky finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more. Where are our beans from? La Unión’s close proximity to the equator means coffee beans can be grown at a relatively high altitude of up to 1900m above sea level. Blessed with such a diverse climate, La Unión coffee is characterised by rich chocolate tones that are balanced and sweet.

We’ve hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cajamarca region of Peru where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has notes of caramel and hazelnut, with a long dark cocoa finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, then slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and a touch of rich black cocoa.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cajamarca coffee beans are unique to the high altitude and mountainous landscape of the region.
With unique micro-climates and fertile soils, Cajamarca coffee’s present deep sweet profiles and thick bodies of flavour with prominent caramel and cocoa notes.
The region’s coffee is the perfect addition to our Hunt and Brew Peru Mocha.

Our hunt has taken us to San Juan in the Intibucá region of Honduras where the high altitude, soil and climate conditions produce a strong bean that has notes of citrus and hazelnut with a cocoa finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more. Where are our beans from? San Juan Intibucá has a cool and often foggy climate, which produces a distinct flavour of coffee found in our Hunt and Brew Honduras blend. The coffee is harvested at high elevation, producing a denser bean with exceptional acidity levels and beautiful complex notes. The result is an earthy brew, with floral and stone fruits up front, hints of malt and toffee mid-way and a dark chocolate finish.
