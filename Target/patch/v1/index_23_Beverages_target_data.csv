Dole Canned 100% Juice is refreshing, exotic and a delicious alternative to other juices. Dole Juice is 100% juice that is an excellent source of Vitamin C and a good source of vitamins A & E. Naturally gluten free and in BPA free packaging, it tastes great on its own, or in your favorite smoothie, mocktail, cocktail, or marinade. Store unopened juice in a cool, dry place. If you prefer a chilled juice, keep an unopened can in your refrigerator. Shake well before serving. After opening, store in a glass or plastic container in the refrigerator.","Nutrition Information

We believe that mother nature has all the answers, and we aim to bring what she gives us to market in the purest way possible without losing the natural nutrients. Sourcing our melons from small farmers, we cold press the rind and flesh, add a touch of filtered water, and a squeeze of lime juice, and bottle it. That’s it! With superior hydration benefits and delicious taste, WTRMLN WTR naturally contains electrolytes and antioxidants to keep you hydrated and rejuvenated in the best way. Drink it for workouts, as an afternoon pick-me-up, or just to stay hydrated throughout the day!

WTRMLN WTR Original Cold Pressed Juiced Watermelon Water, 12 Oz:

DELICIOUS ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER PLANT BASED WATERS: Like coconut water, WTRMLN WTR is naturally low in sugar (45% less than leading juices), and packed with natural electrolytes, antioxidants and vitamins. But nothing beats the juicy taste of watermelon, and other waters lack the natural Lycopene and L-citrulline found in our tasty beverage. It's nature's perfect sports drink.

GOOD FOR YOU: Each bottle of this superfruit juice is bursting with natural electrolytes, antioxidants and vitamins. How much? More electrolytes and 6x the potassium than leading sports drinks! Plus WTRMLN WTR has two special ingredients: Lycopene and L-citrulline, to make your muscles happy.

NO BAD STUFF: No added sugar, sweeteners, artificial flavors or colors.

MADE COLD, SHIPPED COLD, KEEP COLD: We thoughtfully cold press our watermelons in order to maintain the nutrient efficacy, since heating for pasteurization can destroy them. The extra care is worth to ensure we are bringing the best in taste and quality to you.

GREAT SOLO OR AT A PARTY: WTRMLN WTR is delicious on its own, and is also great in smoothies, mocktail and cocktail recipes. Also a great rehydrator for the morning after!

MELONS WITH A MISSION: We source as many 'ugly melons' as we can, that are juicy and delicious on the inside but a little lumpy or bumpy on the outside, saving them from landfills while supporting American and Dominican Republican farmers.","Nutrition Information

Even better, our 16oz and 20oz bottles are recyclable and made from 100% recycled plastic, excluding the cap and label. Snapple always brings the flavor. That's what we have been doing ever since we were a small brand created by three friends in the New York area. We started out by selling our apple juice to health clubs in 1973. Since then, we have expanded our flavor portfolio throughout the 80s into teas, fruit drinks, and lemonades. Snapple went national in the early 90s, and now you can find us in more than 30 flavors and in all 50 states across the country. And for an extra dose of fun, don't forget to check out our Snapple 'Real Facts' under our caps!","Nutrition Information

We believe that mother nature has all the answers, and we aim to bring what she gives us to market in the purest way possible without losing the natural nutrients. Sourcing our melons from small farmers, we cold press the rind and flesh, add a touch of filtered water, and a squeeze of lime juice, and bottle it. That’s it! With superior hydration benefits and delicious taste, WTRMLN WTR naturally contains electrolytes and antioxidants to keep you hydrated and rejuvenated in the best way. Drink it for workouts, as an afternoon pick-me-up, or just to stay hydrated throughout the day!

WTRMLN WTR Original Cold Pressed Juiced Watermelon Water, 12 Oz:

DELICIOUS ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER PLANT BASED WATERS: Like coconut water, WTRMLN WTR is naturally low in sugar (45% less than leading juices), and packed with natural electrolytes, antioxidants and vitamins. But nothing beats the juicy taste of watermelon, and other waters lack the natural Lycopene and L-citrulline found in our tasty beverage. It's nature's perfect sports drink.

GOOD FOR YOU: Each bottle of this superfruit juice is bursting with natural electrolytes, antioxidants and vitamins. How much? More electrolytes and 6x the potassium than leading sports drinks! Plus WTRMLN WTR has two special ingredients: Lycopene and L-citrulline, to make your muscles happy.

NO BAD STUFF: No added sugar, sweeteners, artificial flavors or colors.

MADE COLD, SHIPPED COLD, KEEP COLD: We thoughtfully cold press our watermelons in order to maintain the nutrient efficacy, since heating for pasteurization can destroy them. The extra care is worth to ensure we are bringing the best in taste and quality to you.

GREAT SOLO OR AT A PARTY: WTRMLN WTR is delicious on its own, and is also great in smoothies, mocktail and cocktail recipes. Also a great rehydrator for the morning after!

MELONS WITH A MISSION: We source as many 'ugly melons' as we can, that are juicy and delicious on the inside but a little lumpy or bumpy on the outside, saving them from landfills while supporting American and Dominican Republican farmers.","Nutrition Information

Since then, we have expanded our flavor portfolio throughout the 80s into teas, fruit drinks, and lemonades. Snapple went national in the early 90s, and now you can find us in more than 30 flavors and in all 50 states across the country.

Snapple went national in the early 90s, and now you can find us in more than 30 flavors and in all 50 states across the country.

Our cold-pressed juices are made with all-natural fruits and vegetables - no added sugars.

HOW TO CLEANSE: Although everyone is different and needs to listen to their body as they cleanse, Pressed’s juice plan recommends drinking one 12oz juice every 2 hours in the following order: Avocado Greens Juice, Roots with Ginger Juice, Greens with Ginger Juice, Sweet Citrus Juice. Add one Wellness shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Half-day juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals throughout the day and then break your fast at the end of the day, two hours following your last juice. When breaking your fast, opt for foods that offer healthy fats and proteins. Everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse.

GREENS WITH GINGER - Made from the freshest, highest-quality green vegetables we can find, our green juice is a simple and easy addition to a healthy lifestyle. Our green juice is perfectly blended, so you never have to compromise taste for nutrition.

ROOTS WITH GINGER - We've blended ginger and beets to create delicious juices for all taste buds-from earthy to sweet! Grown deep in the ground, root vegetables absorb high amounts of vitamins and minerals from the soil. They have distinct, earthy flavors and are packed with fiber and complex carbohydrates.

SWEET CITRUS - Our citrus blend is refreshing, hydrating and crisp. It contains ingredients like lemon and mint that provide a pick-me-up when you're feeling down.

AVOCADO GREENS SMOOTHIE - Expertly blended and ready to go, this clean and simple recipe is packed with power greens like spinach, kale, and spirulina, mixed with banana, avocado, and matcha for a creamy-smooth taste.

WELLNESS SHOTS - These shots are lemony with a powerful kick from ginger and cayenne.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 085239119624,https://www.target.com/p/pressed-juicery-half-day-cleanse-bundle-24ct-12-fl-oz-6ct-2-fl-oz-shots/-/A-79369152#lnk=sametab,2024-08-26T22:35:13.969611-04:00,OK

Vita Coco is never made from concentrate. That means we pick, crack, and pack fresh young coconuts directly at the source.

So anyway, you should trust Fanta when it comes to fruit soda. We have a lot of flavors you should try, and they are all super good.
Grab yourself a 12oz 12 pack of Fanta Orange—come on, the decision is easy.","Nutrition Information

Crack a Pepper at dinner, lunch or breakfast (we won’t judge you). The Dr Pepper drink dates back to 1885 when the pharmacist Charles Alderton created the first soft drink with the unique flavor. He blended the smells of his store into the concoction to give it its signature flavor. The owner of the pharmacy he worked at, Morrison, then named it after his friend Dr. Charles Pepper. They patented their drink in December of 1885. It wasn't until the 1950s when they decided to drop the period (.) from the name, changing it from Dr. Pepper to Dr Pepper. Today, original Dr Pepper drinks are found across the globe in the US, Europe, Asia, Mexico, South America, South Africa, Canada and New Zealand.","Nutrition Information

Light, refreshing and full of natural citrus flavors, Squirt is also caffeine-free which makes it the perfect drink to enjoy any time of day. Created by Herb Bishop in Phoenix, Arizona in 1938 toward the end of the Great Depression, his idea was to make a soft drink that required less fruit and sugar than other sodas. When you’re looking for a drink to quench your thirst, the citrus soda always hits the spot. However, if you’re in the mood for a more adult drink for mixers and parties, try adding 1 part tequila to 3 parts Squirt and squeeze in lime for a Paloma, a popular drink in the United States as well as Mexico as far back as the 1950s. Reach for a Squirt when you’re looking for a thoroughly satisfying, refreshingly flavorful drink to quench your thirst with a burst of grapefruit and citrus!","Nutrition Information

As the OG, the head honcho in the lemon-lime flavored soft drink biz, Sprite was, is, and will always be an innovator. An inventor. Keeping things interesting for you, no matter how you drink it. It’s a big challenge, but one that Sprite’s not afraid of—because innovators aren’t afraid of anything.

Every sip of Sprite is refreshing, so it should come as no surprise why Sprite and lemon-lime have become synonymous. As the awe-inspiring trendsetter of the iconic flavor, Sprite never fails to deliver exactly what it promises, every single time. After all, it’s been doing that for 50 years already.

For the people who love a little more zing, there’s a variety of different Sprite flavors, like Cherry and Tropical Mix, as well as zero calorie and zero sugar options. And while the original Sprite is its own brand of perfection, its different flavor options offer a brand-new soda experience.

Sprite delivers intense, crisp citrus taste in every single sip. So when it comes to the ultimate lemon-lime flavored drink, there’s only one place to turn—the flavor that started it all.","Nutrition Information

POWERADE is also equipped with a 6% carbohydrate solution, so your body gets the hydration and energy it needs to power through. We even have vitamins B3, B6 and B12 to support energy metabolism and assist in reducing fatigue. POWERADE has more power so that we can deliver more power for you. This is the sports drink that was developed for athletes like you—to not only keep you in the game, but on top of your game.

Without essential electrolytes like sodium and potassium, we can’t replenish ourselves adequately from everyday life: exercise, travel, late nights or illness. That’s why we made Cure. Based on the World Health Organization’s gold standard of rehydration, known as Oral Rehydration Solution, each packet contains electrolytes and glucose to facilitate rapid hydration directly into your bloodstream. ORS is as effective as an IV drip, but way more convenient. Plus, Cure’s plant-based formula has no added sugars, just natural fruit flavors you’ll love to drink.

Polar Seltzer Premium Sparkling Water. Tiny Bubbles: The sparkle sets us apart. We've been perfecting the process of making our signature bubbles, with their long-lasting carbonation and crispness, since 1882. The bubbles are created by carefully dissolving Co2 into water at high pressure and freezing temperatures without exposing the flavors to oxygen. Other people may add sodium or sweeteners to shortcut the road to quality – we do not. Natural Flavors: The taste of our seltzers is defined by the quality ingredients of the ingredients we used. Our approach is to use only the highest-quality, proprietary combinations of flavors and aromas for depth and complexity. These ingredients are extracted and distilled from natural sources (such as lemon peel, lime, mint, etc.) to create highly concentrated “essences”. Relying on copious amounts of these very precious oils, we never skimp when it comes to taste. Triple-Filtered & Locally Sourced Water: Our water is locally sourced and then triple-filtered with our state-of-the-art process to ensure a consistent and authentic Polar Seltzer taste. NO sodium, fluoride, or other funny business added. This is why Polar Seltzer makes for health smart hydration. Family Made Since 1882: Just water, zillions of tiny bubbles, and great taste. Our family has been crafting Polar Seltzer with these same ingredients since 1882. That’s 138 years to perfect what our great-great-grandfather called the world’s best-tasting bubble recipe. At Polar Beverages we work hard to keep things uncomplicated, refreshing and endlessly creative. Take a sip, and let us know.","Nutrition Information

well, xxx is the same acai-blueberry-pomegranate flavored water beverage with vitamins and deliciousness, but now it’s a bazillion times more good because of all the nutrient enhancements and its sports-level hydration. and yes, it still has an iconic color moment everywhere it goes (we could never change that). 

okay, okay, let’s get to the point. what does this upgrade mean for you? it means vitamins. and electrolytes. and more nutrients. which are all good things. with 80 calories per 16.9oz bottle. 

it also means this vitaminwater xxx has three types of antioxidants to help fight free radicals: vitamin A, vitamin C and selenium.

and that's bad news for the people who like bad stuff. 

so, make sure to pick up a pack if you’re a do-gooder or a good stuff appreciator or a color icon, just like us.","Nutrition Information

A lot has changed since we got our start in 1845, but at least one thing remains the same: Poland Spring Brand 100% Natural Spring Water is still sourced from our carefully selected springs in Maine.
Helping Keep Maine Beautiful
We treat each spring source with the great care and respect it deserves. Springs are regularly monitored by our natural resource managers and field experts for quality and sustainability. We’re proud to share their hard work.
What Is Spring Water Anyway?
Great question. According to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA): “Spring Water is water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth at an identified location.” To be able to label our product as “spring water,” we have to satisfy stringent standards — standards we proudly meet or exceed. That’s why every bottle of Poland Spring Brand water is labeled as 100% natural.","Nutrition Information

RED BULL GIVES YOU WINGS

Our chocolate milk is made with a rich blend of three European cocoas and a little sweetness (a special Erickson Family recipe). In fact, we use about double the amount of cocoas compared to others. The ratio of carbs to protein (3:1) make chocolate milk a proven sports recovery drink. And, kids who drink chocolate milk have better quality diets, do not consume more sugar, fat and calories, and do not have a higher body mass index1.

Our Liquid Remedy Kombucha Raspberry Lemonade has a perfect lemon zesty, sweet berry balance with all the gut-lovin’ benefits of booch.

Liquid Remedy organic kombucha is the perfect everyday gut health swap for vinegary probiotic drinks, prebiotic soda, juice, or sparkling water because we keep it real with strong, happy, & healthy live cultures that are raw and native to our brew - never pasteurized and never dosed.

We brew out all the sugar traditionally over 30 days for a well-balanced flavor profile without the weird aftertaste. AND because Liquid Remedy is sugar-free, there’s no risk of refermentation so Liquid Remedy Kombucha can be stored in or out of the fridge.

No need to wait for the weekend to sip on this pink lemonade flavor. Find us in store in Target in the juice aisle (not the cooler.)","Nutrition Information

Crack a Pepper at dinner, lunch or breakfast (we won’t judge you). The Dr Pepper drink dates back to 1885 when the pharmacist Charles Alderton created the first soft drink with the unique flavor. He blended the smells of his store into the concoction to give it its signature flavor. The owner of the pharmacy he worked at, Morrison, then named it after his friend Dr. Charles Pepper. They patented their drink in December of 1885. It wasn't until the 1950s when they decided to drop the period (.) from the name, changing it from Dr. Pepper to Dr Pepper. Today, original Dr Pepper drinks are found across the globe in the US, Europe, Asia, Mexico, South America, South Africa, Canada and New Zealand.","Nutrition Information

Tiny Bubbles: The sparkle sets us apart. We've been perfecting the process of making our signature bubbles, with their long-lasting carbonation and crispness, since 1882. The bubbles are created by carefully dissolving Co2 into water at high pressure and freezing temperatures without exposing the flavors to oxygen. Other people may add sodium or sweeteners to shortcut the road to quality – we do not. Natural Flavors: The taste of our seltzers is defined by the quality ingredients of the ingredients we used. Our approach is to use only the highest-quality, proprietary combinations of flavors and aromas for depth and complexity. These ingredients are extracted and distilled from natural sources (such as lemon peel, lime, mint, etc.) to create highly concentrated “essences”. Relying on copious amounts of these very precious oils, we never skimp when it comes to taste. Triple-Filtered & Locally Sourced Water: Our water is locally sourced and then triple-filtered with our state-of-the-art process to ensure a consistent and authentic Polar Seltzer taste. NO sodium, fluoride, or other funny business added. This is why Polar Seltzer makes for health-smart hydration. Family Made Since 1882: Just water, zillions of tiny bubbles, and great taste. Our family has been crafting Polar Seltzer with these same ingredients since 1882. That’s 138 years to perfect what our great-great-grandfather called the world’s best-tasting bubble recipe. At Polar Beverages we work hard to keep things uncomplicated, refreshing and endlessly creative. Take a sip, and let us know.","Nutrition Information
