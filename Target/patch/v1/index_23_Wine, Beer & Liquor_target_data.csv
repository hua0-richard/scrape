The juice is fermented at various intervals throughout the year allowing the wine to remain fresh and delicate. The Riboli family uses this technique to capture the fresh flavors of blackberry, blueberry, and raspberry. During the fermentation process, the alcohol is created in tandem with the wine’s natural carbonation. Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the wine is centrifuged and bottled. Its natural acidity and low pH strike the perfect balance with the wine’s inherent sweetness. It is not cloying or heavy. Serve chilled by-the-glass, pour over ice, or mix with your favorite spirit for an all-natural, fruit-forward cocktail.","Nutrition Information

The juice is fermented at various intervals throughout the year allowing the wine to remain fresh and delicate. The Riboli family uses this technique to capture the natural flavors of ripe mango and exotic passion fruit. During the fermentation process, the alcohol is created in tandem with the wine’s natural carbonation. Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the wine is centrifuged and bottled. Its natural acidity and low pH strike the perfect balance with the wine’s inherent sweetness. It is not cloying or heavy.

The result was a delicious cocktail made with gin and citrus soda that soon became a Finnish tradition. Unlike malt-based seltzers or hard ciders made with fermented sugar, Long Drink is made with an award-winning liquor that is smooth, refreshing and doesn't leave you with that full beer feeling. The Long Drink is in a category all its own, and the Cranberry flavor is a balanced mix of real liquor and natural cranberry flavors. Gluten free and all natural, The Long Drink Cranberry offers a unique flavor that everyone loves. This 6 pack of The Long Drink Cranberry is perfect for enjoying during a relaxing night in or with friends for any event where alcoholic beverages are appreciated. An award-winning ready to drink cocktail, The Long Drink received Gold at the NY International Spirit Competition, American Distilling Institute, Proof Awards and Tastings.com.

The rose wine has natural flavors of watermelon that are created using a distillation process of Italian fruits grown in southern Italy. The grapes are harvested, pressed, centrifuged, and then held cold as juice at 28 degrees Fahrenheit. The juice is fermented at various intervals throughout the year allowing the wine to remain fresh and delicate. The Riboli family uses this technique to create an off-dry Rose, busting with fresh flavors and natural carbonation. During fermentation, the alcohol is created in tandem with the wine’s natural carbonation. Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the wine is centrifuged and bottled. Its natural acidity and low pH strike the perfect balance with the wine’s inherent sweetness. It is not cloying or heavy. Serve chilled by the glass, pour over ice, or mix with your favorite spirit for an all-natural, fruit-forward cocktail.","Nutrition Information

The juice is fermented at various intervals throughout the year allowing the wine to remain fresh and delicate. The Riboli family uses this technique to create a refreshing wine, busting with fresh flavors. During fermentation, the alcohol is created in tandem with the wine’s natural carbonation. Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the wine is centrifuged and bottled. Its natural acidity and low pH strike the perfect balance with the wine’s inherent sweetness. Serve chilled by the glass, pour over ice, or mix with your favorite spirit for an all-natural, fruit-forward cocktail.","Nutrition Information

The wine has natural flavors of watermelon that are created using a distillation process of Italian fruits grown in southern Italy. The grapes are harvested, pressed, centrifuged, and then held cold as juice at 28 degrees Fahrenheit. The juice is fermented at various intervals throughout the year allowing the wine to remain fresh and delicate. The Riboli family uses this technique to create an off-dry Rose, busting with fresh flavors and natural carbonation. During the fermentation process, the alcohol is created in tandem with the wine’s natural carbonation. Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the wine is centrifuged and bottled. Its natural acidity and low pH strike the perfect balance with the wine’s inherent sweetness. It is not cloying or heavy. Serve chilled by the glass, pour over ice, or mix with your favorite spirit for an all-natural, fruit-forward cocktail.","Nutrition Information
