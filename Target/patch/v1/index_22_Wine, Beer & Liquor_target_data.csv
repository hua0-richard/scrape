The juice is fermented at various intervals throughout the year allowing the wine to remain fresh and delicate. The Riboli family uses this technique to capture the fresh flavors of blackberry, blueberry, and raspberry. During the fermentation process, the alcohol is created in tandem with the wine’s natural carbonation. Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the wine is centrifuged and bottled. Its natural acidity and low pH strike the perfect balance with the wine’s inherent sweetness. It is not cloying or heavy. Serve chilled by-the-glass, pour over ice, or mix with your favorite spirit for an all-natural, fruit-forward cocktail.","Nutrition Information
