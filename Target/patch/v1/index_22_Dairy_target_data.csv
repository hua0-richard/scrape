Before leaving our family farms, Prairie Farms milk goes through strict quality control measures to guarantee freshness and is always free from artificial growth hormones and antibiotics. Within 24 hours, the milk is delivered to one of our farmer-owned facilities for production and packaging into a wide variety of high-quality dairy products. This process sets Prairie Farms Whole Milk apart because we are 100% in control of the farm-to-table cycle.

Did you know each time you buy Prairie Farms Whole Milk you are supporting local dairy farm families? Visit one of our farms on any given day, and you’ll find family members pitching in. We love our cows, and you’ll find them relaxing in a barn or grazing in a pasture. They always have access to plenty of clean water and food – often they eat before we do! Prairie Farms’ Animal Care Program, F.A.R.M., is recognized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for its industry-leading animal care standards.

Whether it’s caring for our cows or caring for the land using sustainable farming practices, producing the highest quality Whole Milk and naturally good dairy products has been the Prairie Farms way since 1938. Dedicated Farmers | Happy Cows | Real Milk | PrairieFarms.com.","Nutrition Information

Our chocolate milk is made with a rich blend of three European cocoas and a little sweetness (a special Erickson Family recipe). In fact, we use about double the amount of cocoas compared to others. The ratio of carbs to protein (3:1) make chocolate milk a proven sports recovery drink. And, kids who drink chocolate milk have better quality diets, do not consume more sugar, fat and calories, and do not have a higher body mass index1.

Original Spread 15 oz is not just a fantastic way to add delicious buttery flavor to your favorite foods, it’s also what you yell pretty much every time you taste it. And how fun is that? We’ll tell you: a lot of fun. Compared to dairy butter, per 1 tbsp. serving, I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter! Original Spread has less saturated fat, fewer calories, and more omega-3 ALAs. 375mg of omega-3 ALA (23% of the 1.6g daily value) compared to 44mg (1.1% of the 1.6g daily value) contained in dairy butter to be exact. Also, unlike dairy butter, I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter! Original Spread meets the nutritional requirements of the American Heart Association Heart-Check Food Certification Program. It’s made with good fats from plant-based oils, including soybean oil. Supportive but not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about one and a half tablespoons (20.5g) of soybean oil daily, which contains unsaturated fat, may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Made with simple ingredients such as a delicious blend of plant-based oils, purified water, and a pinch of salt. I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter! Original Spread delivers unbelievable buttery goodness with no artificial flavors, and no artificial preservatives. Per 1 tablespoon serving, it has 6g total fat and 0g of trans-fat, and just 60 calories. At 2g of saturated fat per 1 tablespoon serving, that's 70% less than what dairy butter has! And when a guest comes over and sees I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter! in your fridge? They’re smiling...guaranteed. I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter! Isn’t just a good decision, it’s also a pretty good time. Now go ahead and say the name again. Out loud. It feels great, pinky swear.","Nutrition Information

It also has a wonderful, gulp-able texture without stabilizers, gums or thickeners to ruin the vibe. And the beta-glucans (big, scientific word for soluble fiber) in this one are strong and handsome.

And if you're one of those nice people, how cool and weird is it that you're reading this paragraph on this website at this moment about this amazing Low-Fat Oatmilk, a cow milk alternative with all the flavor of beautiful gluten-free oats and only one gram of unsaturated fat per serving? The universe apparently also wants you to know that this product has beta-glucans (big, scientific word for soluble fiber) and no dairy, nuts, soy, gluten or GMOs. But right now we're talking about less fat. Or karma. Well, whatever we're talking about, it's the good kind.

BTW, this Oatly milk keeps things simple with just oats, water, a hint of sea salt and some calcium, vitamins and minerals to keep things on the healthy side. The slightly sweet flavor of oats is front and center and delicious on cereal, in recipes, or poured into a nice glass and gulped—or you can lean into the whole simple thing, skip the glass altogether and gulp it right from the container.

We made something you’ll both love —really.

You’ve never had a milk alternative like Bored Cow®. Packed with sustainable protein, rich in calcium and vitamin D, and 100% lactose free and vegan-friendly, it’s truly the first milk alternative to do it all. Did we mention it looks, feels, tastes, cooks, bakes, freezes, froths, foams & steams just like the real thing too? Oat milk could never!

So, what’s our secret? We start with plant fat, cane sugar, and milk protein from fermentation instead of cows. Imagine a microbrewery that makes milk ingredients! Then we add vitamins and minerals like calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. The rest of our ingredients are 100% plant-based, and make Bored Cow the richest, creamiest milk alternative in the grocery aisle. 

But it isn’t just better for people and animals. It’s better for the planet too. From farm to factory, Bored Cow requires up to 96% less land, uses up to 67% less water, and generates up to 44% fewer emissions than conventional and organic dairy milk. We’re also B Corp certified, which means we’ve met the highest standards for social and environmental performance.

Give cows a break! Your new favorite milk alternative is here. ","Nutrition Information

That's four times more protein per serving than the leading traditional yogurt, which contains 6g of protein per six-ounce serving. We make our gluten free yogurt alternative with mindful ingredients including ultra-filtered milk and whey protein. And every serving contains live active yogurt cultures. Natural flavors help deliver great taste without adding additional sugar. Enjoy the single serve snacks instead of Greek yogurt as a convenient breakfast food, or stash the protein snacks in the refrigerator at work to help you stay the course. Keep ratio gluten free snack cups cold in the refrigerator until you’re ready to enjoy them. Ratio strikes a unique combination of protein, carbs and sugar. With a focus on carefully selected ingredients, it's a great snack to help keep you going.

A creamy, delicious snack cup contains 25g of protein and 3g of sugar. That's four times more protein per serving than the leading traditional yogurt, which contains 6g of protein per six-ounce serving. We make our gluten free yogurt alternative with mindful ingredients including ultra-filtered milk and whey protein. And every serving contains live active yogurt cultures. Natural flavors help deliver great taste without adding additional sugar. Enjoy the single serve snacks instead of Greek yogurt as a convenient breakfast food, or stash the protein snacks in the refrigerator at work to help you stay the course. Keep ratio gluten free snack cups cold in the refrigerator until you’re ready to enjoy them. Ratio strikes a unique combination of protein, carbs and sugar. With a focus on carefully selected ingredients, it's a great snack to help keep you going. Find all five tasty flavors in the yogurt aisle, including strawberry, blueberry, coconut, key lime and vanilla.","Nutrition Information

Enjoy the single serve snacks instead of Greek yogurt as a convenient breakfast addition, or stash the protein snacks in the refrigerator at work to help you stay the course. Keep Ratio gluten free snack cups cold in the refrigerator until you're ready to enjoy them. Ratio strikes a unique combination of protein, carbs and sugar. With a focus on carefully selected ingredients, it's a great snack to help keep you going. Look for other tasty flavors in the yogurt aisle.

A creamy, delicious 5.3 oz snack cup contains 25g of protein and 3g of sugar. That's four times more protein per serving than the leading traditional yogurt, which contains 6g of protein per six-ounce serving - every win counts! We make our gluten free yogurt alternative with mindful ingredients including ultra-filtered milk and whey protein. And every serving contains live active yogurt cultures. Enjoy the single serve snacks instead of Greek yogurt as a convenient breakfast addition, or stash the protein snacks in the refrigerator at work to help you stay the course. Keep Ratio gluten free snack cups cold in the refrigerator until you're ready to enjoy them. Ratio strikes a unique combination of protein, carbs and sugar. With a focus on carefully selected ingredients, it's a great snack to help keep you going. Look for other tasty flavors in the yogurt aisle.
