The smell of freshly roasted coffee came to Bellingham in 1971. From the beginning, we roasted our coffee in small batches, selecting the best beans we could find from around the world.

In the early years we roasted in our coffeehouse, a street level space in Fairhaven’s historic Terminal Building. We filled glass jars with freshly-roasted beans from Antigua to Yirgacheffe.

The coffeehouse brought locally-roasted coffee and espresso to Bellingham, becoming one of the cultural staples in the community. From the start, it was clear to us that coffee brings people together.

Our roasting operation has long since outgrown the coffeehouse, but we are still proud to call Bellingham home.

Even after 40 years of roasting coffee, not a day goes by that we don’t discover something new. We have a passion for learning, which is why our crew regularly participates in Roasters Guild workshops, studying topics ranging from thermodynamics to sensory triangulation. Simply put, we’re constantly striving to develop the best flavors possible from our coffees.

We are keenly aware of the many hands it takes to prepare a great cup of coffee. Alfredo Pacas, a third-generation Salvadoran coffee farmer, and a direct trade partner of ours, says it best: “When I taste a great cup of coffee, I stop, because I know that it’s a miracle.”

We travel every year to meet with farmers and taste improvements in cup quality.

These relationships help to broaden our understanding and appreciation for all that goes into making a great cup of coffee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 750339750199,https://www.target.com/p/tony-39-scaf-233-carmelita-medium-roast-ground-coffee-12oz/-/A-52125906#lnk=sametab,2024-08-28T02:22:01.689593-04:00,OK

It takes plenty of sun to dry all the way through the skin and sweet pulp of the coffee fruit to the seeds inside. This is done on well-tended patios, where whole cherries are raked continuously, and also on the trees, where a portion of the pickings are left to dry on the branch. All of our favorite farms also produce coffees by the “pulped natural” method, which involves removing the skin and some of the fruit pulp from the outset, and the “washed” method, which fully removes it, as is the standard in countries like Costa Rica. In Brazil, with lower altitudes and less acidity, we find the typical washed coffee to be somewhat bland.

Ground Coffee.

DAZBOG Coffee is the realization of the American Dream by two immigrants of the former Soviet Union, Anatoly and Leonid Yuffa. The dream that is now DAZBOG began on a bitter, cold night among the cobblestone streets of Lennigrad. The Yuffa family fled Russia to embark on a new and better life of freedom, democracy and opportunity. Their journey is the legacy of DAZBOG Coffee - bringing the richness of the Russian heritage and traditions to their quest for roasting only the finest quality Arabica beans from coffee estates around the world. Anatoly and Leonid have found a way to honor the past and enjoy the present in a rich-tasting cup of coffee. This is the Dazbog way. A way that applauds free expression by bringing out the unique flavor of every bean. A way that celebrates life itself in each and every cup.

Made with the finest Arabica beans from regions around the world, our coffees are roasted the traditional way. The old-world way. The slow way. Where the rich, smooth taste is everything and every moment counts. True, it's a slow process, not hurried like modern methods, yet one that respects the sweet natural characteristics of each bean. Taking the time to roast coffee the old-world way creates a smoother taste as each bean is allowed to mature and develop, thus making a greater contribution to the overall richness of the blend. DAZBOG's roasting produces a complex taste, one might even say a heartier, wealthier taste. It's old-world Russian craftsmanship you can savor with each cup. So slow down. Take the time. Savor the DAZBOG moment . . . and celebrate the heavenly richness of each bean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 641160120940,https://www.target.com/p/dazbog-svoboda-blend-medium-roast-ground-coffee-11oz/-/A-48630603#lnk=sametab,2024-08-28T03:47:51.920439-04:00,OK

For generations these families have grown and picked from their own 'back-yard' plots, ranging 1-4 acres in size. Incredibly, coffee here flourishes in the wild as a sustainable cash crop along with a variety of mango and banana. Once the coffee cherries are pulped and washed, they're fermented for between 16-48 hours (depending on temperature, cloud cover, etc) and then laid out to sun dry on drying tables where they're stirred regularly and covered when the sun is hottest, from noon to 3:00PM. The Kassa family history with coffee runs deep; a few decades ago his grandfather received a 1,200 acre land grant in Guji during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. Aklilu's father made Guji history in 1995 by founding the very first privately-owned washing station, following many years working as a cherry collections agent. This first wash station by the name of Kassa Chirressa was where Aklilu, then 28, began working for his father, who still operates the mill. ""At that time"" recalls Akilu, ""Guji along with Yirgacheffe, Kochere, and dozens of other now-distinct districts were known as Sidama coffee. As an aside, Hegar Mariam is 186 rough-and-tumble miles from Kenya's northern border. The Guji Zone of Southern Ethiopia borders the lush zones of Sidama and West Arsi to the north, the Bale Zone to the east, and the famous Gedeo Zone to the West. Given their closeness, Guji and Gedeo share many crossover characteristics in coffee processing and production, resulting in similar bright, sparkly coffees with heavy floral notes and an overall delicacy. Coffee production in these zones (and throughout the majority of Ethiopia) is generally achieved by small farm holders and cooperatives and not single estate owners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 857783008071,https://www.target.com/p/mt-whitney-coffee-roasters-organic-ethiopia-guji-ground-coffee-medium-roast-12-oz-340-g/-/A-86977055#lnk=sametab,2024-08-28T06:07:36.188687-04:00,OK

At nearly 6,500 feet elevation in the Oromia Region and West Guji Zone, Akilu produces Typica and other local heirloom varieties (one aptly named simply ""Guji"") under the protection of natural shade trees that include enset (false banana), bamboo, avocado and lastly wanza, which is a multi-purpose, indigenous tree whose leaves are used as fertilizer and wood for fuel, tools and furniture. This coffee is also C.A.F.E. certified as being sustainably grown and processed, a ranking achieved through the evaluation of economic, social and environmental aspects of the coffee production. In the cup you'll find a distinct brightness and a layering of notes of lemonade, pink lady apple, coffee flower, dried eucalyptus, lemon balm and english breakfast tea. Akilu Kassa and his son, Biniam are the chief operators and proud owners of the Bedessa wash station which draws its water from the nearby stream named ""Dhadhatu"". For generations these families have grown and picked from their own 'back-yard' plots, ranging 1-4 acres in size. Incredibly, coffee here flourishes in the wild as a sustainable cash crop along with a variety of mango and banana. Once the coffee cherries are pulped and washed, they're fermented for between 16-48 hours (depending on temperature, cloud cover, etc) and then laid out to sun dry on drying tables where they're stirred regularly and covered when the sun is hottest, from noon to 3:00PM. The Kassa family history with coffee runs deep; a few decades ago his grandfather received a 1,200 acre land grant in Guji during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. Aklilu's father made Guji history in 1995 by founding the very first privately-owned washing station, following many years working as a cherry collections agent. This first wash station by the name of Kassa Chirressa was where Aklilu, then 28, began working for his father, who still operates the mill. ""At that time"" recalls Akilu, ""Guji along with Yirgacheffe, Kochere, and dozens of other now-distinct districts were known as Sidama coffee. As an aside, Hegar Mariam is 186 rough-and-tumble miles from Kenya's northern border. The Guji Zone of Southern Ethiopia borders the lush zones of Sidama and West Arsi to the north, the Bale Zone to the east, and the famous Gedeo Zone to the West. Given their closeness, Guji and Gedeo share many crossover characteristics in coffee processing and production, resulting in similar bright, sparkly coffees with heavy floral notes and an overall delicacy. Coffee production in these zones (and throughout the majority of Ethiopia) is generally achieved by small farm holders and cooperatives and not single estate owners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 857783008064,https://www.target.com/p/mt-whitney-coffee-roasters-organic-ethiopia-guji-whole-bean-coffee-medium-roast-12-oz-340-g/-/A-86977101#lnk=sametab,2024-08-28T09:31:52.580890-04:00,OK

ABOUT KAHAWA 1893:

Kahawa 1893 is a specialty coffee company founded and run by Margaret Nyamumbo, a third-generation coffee farmer from Kenya. Kahawa means coffee in Swahili, the primary language spoken there. Margaret grew up on a coffee farm in Kisii, four hours from Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

As a child, Margaret observed that women supply 90% of coffee production labor but often see little or no financial gain. She founded Kahawa 1893 to help empower the women that make coffee trade possible and share exquisite African beans with the world.

Kahawa 1893’s packaging contains a QR code. When scanned, customers can learn our relationships with farmers and support them by tipping.

This flavorful blend features beans sourced from two distinct (and equally-celebrated) regions within the country, Yirgacheffe and Guji. You'll have the best of both worlds in every sip.
The Yirgacheffe beans are sourced from Bedhatu Jibicho, who has been cultivating coffee on her farm since the 1950s. She is over 80 and is passing on the traditional techniques of processing Ethiopian coffee to the next generation. 
The Guji beans are naturally-processed, which involves drying them in the sun while still inside of the coffee cherry. Natural processing imparts a fruity sweetness to the beans, and they can be easily enjoyed without sugar or milk.

ABOUT KAHAWA 1893:
Kahawa 1893 is a specialty coffee company founded and run by Margaret Nyamumbo, a third-generation coffee farmer from Kenya. Kahawa means “coffee” in Swahili, the primary language spoken there. Margaret grew up on a coffee farm in Kisii, four hours from Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

As a child, Margaret observed that women supply 90% of coffee production labor but often see little or no financial gain. She founded Kahawa 1893 to help empower the women that make coffee trade possible and share exquisite African beans with the world.

Kahawa 1893’s packaging contains a QR code. When scanned, customers can learn our relationships with farmers and support them by tipping.

ABOUT KAHAWA 1893:
Kahawa 1893 is a specialty coffee company founded and run by Margaret Nyamumbo, a third-generation coffee farmer from Kenya. Kahawa means “coffee” in Swahili, the primary language spoken there. Margaret grew up on a coffee farm in Kisii, four hours from Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

As a child, Margaret observed that women supply 90% of coffee production labor but often see little or no financial gain. She founded Kahawa 1893 to help empower the women that make coffee trade possible and share exquisite African beans with the world.

Kahawa 1893’s packaging contains a QR code. When scanned, customers can learn our relationships with farmers and support them by tipping. We match all tips dollar-for-dollar to double the impact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 860006439163,https://www.target.com/p/kahawa-1893-serengeti-dark-roast-coffee-12oz/-/A-83169738#lnk=sametab,2024-08-29T04:32:10.728023-04:00,OK

At the same time, we know that specialty coffee remains intimidating & unwelcoming for many coffee drinkers, so HUCK seeks to be friendly and approachable to all people who walk through our doors or bring our coffee into their homes & offices.

Blue Orchid Blend was named after a song that rocked the walls of our first roasting “warehouse” in 2011 – in truth, it was a tiny garage in the founder’s house in Denver, Colorado next door to a backyard chicken coop. Blue Orchid is Huckleberry Roaster’s house espresso blend that we serve every day in our cafes, and it is designed to be approachable, both as espresso and as a brewed coffee, with and without milk.

While the Blue Orchid blend components do change with the coffee seasons, HUCK’s team of award-winning coffee roasters maintain a year-round sweet, full-bodied, chocolate and caramel flavor profile by using Central and South American coffees specifically chosen for those qualities.

This is great tasting comfort coffee, and is a well-rounded crowd pleaser, especially if some of that crowd likes cream in their cup, or is still making the transition from darker roast profiles into specialty coffee.

Are you ready for an adventure?! Phantom Limb Blend is the wildest of Huckleberry Roasters’ blends. We conceived Phantom Limb to focus on fruit-forward flavors that one might not expect from a traditional espresso or drip coffee blend.

Phantom Limb Blend is an East African showcase, highlighting both natural and washed coffees from the region. HUCK’s Phantom Limb will taste great as espresso and drip, but is intended to showcase the unexpected, unique flavors of its components - jam and berries from the natural processed coffee, and the lemonade, clean, floral goodness we love in washed East African coffees - rather than adhere to anyone’s idea of a “traditional” espresso or coffee blend.

If you are like us and eat a lot of candy…you can think of our Blue Orchid Blend as your Tootsie Roll or Milky Way, and Phantom Limb Blend as your bag of Jolly Ranchers or pack of Starbursts.

Even though we tend to use Phantom Limb as espresso in our own cafes, it will also taste great as a brewed coffee at home!

Please note, many people suffer from phantom pain, limb loss or limb difference (including customers of ours) and therefore with every purchase of this blend we try to raise awareness and money by donating a portion of proceeds to Colorado amputee support organizations. All of our coffee blends are named after songs that have significance for our company's history. Phantom Limb is named after a song that was one of the first conversations Huckleberry Roasters’ founders ever had!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 850365006151,https://www.target.com/p/huckleberry-roasters-phantom-limb-espresso-roast-coffee-12oz/-/A-88550299#lnk=sametab,2024-08-30T18:38:22.258557-04:00,OK

To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cats. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully cleaned, sun-dried, and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume. Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy, and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.

Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia

Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available. Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life.

We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet that maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.

Kaya Kopi Honey (Luwak Enzymatic Process) Kaya Kopi Honey starts its life from the very same beans that would have been ingested by wild Palm Civets. However, instead of the Luwak cats eating the berries, our farmers collect the beans. The finest beans are collected and then undergo a floating selection process, which leaves only perfect beans of the same density and ripeness. Next, the beans are pulped and dried in a greenhouse for 20 days while undergoing an enzymatic and fermentation process. This process utilizes organic local honey as a catalyst and mimics the process of digestion that occurs in the stomachs of the civet cats. The final result is an exceptionally flavored coffee with an astounding aroma profile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 711583598401,https://www.target.com/p/kaya-kopi-premium-kopi-luwak-from-indonesia-wild-palm-civets-arabica-coffee-beans/-/A-90510030?preselect=90510072#lnk=sametab,2024-08-30T18:40:54.195426-04:00,OK

The beans were swollen and had a pale yellow color much different from how they were originally harvested.

Unroasted coffee is similarly exposed to elements and then sold to roasters all over the world to reproduce the same mellow cup that started an entire movement.Monsoon Malabar coffee is prepared from Arabica cherries (cherry refers to dry-processed coffees in India). After grading, the coffee is transported to the coastal city of Mangalore where the monsooning is carried out in large open-walled warehouses.

To produce this coffee, coffee berries are eaten by the Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries come in contact with proteolytic enzymes, which change the composition of the coffee berries. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them, wash them, and remove the outer layer of the beans. The beans are then sun-dried and roasted at around 400 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean.

This coffee is 2/3 natural, wild luwak and 1/3 honey processed luwak. The honey processed luwak undergoes an enzymatic process controlled by our team in a special greenhouse. We are able to change the chemistry of the coffee cherries by relying on the same fermentation process that occurs in the civets. We use organic compounds and a natural fermentation process using the sugar present in honey.

Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Campur is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss.

The Kaya Kopi farm - where we collect and produce Kaya Kopi Campur - is situated 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia.

Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available.

Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life. We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper dieand therefore the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 782290545965,https://www.target.com/p/premium-kopi-campur-kopi-luwak-from-indonesia-wild-palm-civets-coffee-beans-medium-roast-250-grams/-/A-92488781#lnk=sametab,2024-08-30T23:03:18.078902-04:00,OK

And the best part? Our 32 fl oz bottle of Chameleon Organic Vanilla cold-brew Concentrate makes up to 64 oz of your favorite brew!

How to use cold-brew concentrate:
No two days are the same, so why should your coffee have to be?
The best part about using concentrate is the ability to make it your own.
We recommend starting with a 1:1 ratio (1 part coffee concentrate to 1 part of your favorite mix-in) and then adjusting the recipe until you find your sweet spot.

What is concentrate and how does it differ from “ready-to-drink” cold-brew?
Ready-to-drink cold-brew and cold-brew concentrate are essentially made with the same process, the main difference being that concentrate allows you a more customizable cup. Because it’s stronger, you can adjust concentrates to your desired flavor and caffeine content. Both are made using specialty grade organic coffee steeped for 11-12 hours at ambient temperatures to create a smooth, low acidity, highly caffeinated coffee.

Cold-brew vs Iced Coffee - what is the difference?
Iced coffee is made from brewed hot coffee poured over ice, which dilutes its flavor and creates a weaker taste. Brewing with hot water typically takes about 5 minutes, and results in a more bitter, more acidic, and midler tasting coffee drink.

Cold-brew coffee, on the other hand, is steeped over long periods of time and never introduced to heat. This extracts the sugars, oils, and caffeine, and yields a smoother, sweeter, less acidic tasting coffee than iced coffee. Unlike iced coffee,
which is best enjoyed immediately, cold-brew can usually be kept refrigerated for days, and can be enjoyed hot or cold, with great versatility.

There’s a perfect ratio for steeping the most delicious cold-brew, and it’s right here in this bottle.",,"Ingredients: Organic Cold Brew Coffee (Water, Organic Coffee)",,,,,,,,,,,,,UPC: 851220003414,https://www.target.com/p/chameleon-cold-brew-black-coffee-concentrate-32-fl-oz/-/A-16558973#lnk=sametab,2024-08-29T07:03:34.494437-04:00,OK

Lovingly handcrafted, this blend is super smooth with low acidity. One 32 fl oz bottle of Chameleon Organic Vanilla cold-brew Concentrate makes up to 64 oz of your favorite brew.

How to use cold-brew concentrate:
No two days are the same, so why should your coffee have to be?
The best part about using concentrate is the ability to make it your own.

We recommend starting with a 1:1 ratio (1 part coffee concentrate to 1 part of your favorite mix-in) and then adjusting the recipe until you find your sweet spot.

What is concentrate and how does it differ from “ready-to-drink” cold-brew?
Ready-to-drink cold-brew and cold-brew concentrate are essentially made with the same process, the main difference being that concentrate allows you a more customizable cup. Because it’s stronger, you can adjust concentrate to your desired flavor and caffeine content. Both are made using specialty grade organic coffee steeped for 11-12 hours at ambient temperatures to create a smooth, low acidity, highly caffeinated coffee.


cold-brew vs Iced Coffee - what is the difference?
Iced coffee is made from brewed hot coffee poured over ice, which dilutes its flavor and creates a weaker taste and caffeine content. Brewing with hot water typically takes about 5 minutes, and results in a more bitter, more acidic, and midler tasting coffee drink.

Cold-brew coffee, on the other hand, is steeped over long periods of time and never introduced to heat. This extracts the sugars, oils, and caffeine, and yields a smoother, sweeter, less acidic tasting coffee that has a higher caffeine content than iced coffee. Unlike iced coffee, which is best enjoyed immediately, cold-brew can usually be kept refrigerated for up to 2 weeks, and can be enjoyed hot or cold, with great versatility.

There’s a perfect ratio for steeping the most delicious cold-brew, and it’s right here in this bottle.","Nutrition Information

Chaga contains a complex array of bioactive compounds with significant antioxidant and immunity-supporting activities.* Cordyceps improves vitality and endurance naturally by supporting respiration, oxygen delivery and ATP synthesis. Cordyceps supports aerobic endurance in athletes and research related to general vitality in senior populations gives this mushroom species broad appeal. Cordyceps is also known for its ability to increase circulation.* Lion's Mane is reported in many studies to stimulate the synthesis of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a protein that promotes the growth and normal function of nerve cells. NGF is important for cognitive and neurological health.* Revered in Traditional Medicine as the “Mushroom of Immortality”, Reishi has a variety of attributes. Reishi acts as an immune potentiator and immune modulator - helping to balance and down regulate an overactive immune system. Reishi has also been studied for its cardiovascular health benefits.
