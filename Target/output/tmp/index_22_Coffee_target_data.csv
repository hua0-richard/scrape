The smell of freshly roasted coffee came to Bellingham in 1971. From the beginning, we roasted our coffee in small batches, selecting the best beans we could find from around the world.

In the early years we roasted in our coffeehouse, a street level space in Fairhaven’s historic Terminal Building. We filled glass jars with freshly-roasted beans from Antigua to Yirgacheffe.

The coffeehouse brought locally-roasted coffee and espresso to Bellingham, becoming one of the cultural staples in the community. From the start, it was clear to us that coffee brings people together.

Our roasting operation has long since outgrown the coffeehouse, but we are still proud to call Bellingham home.

Even after 40 years of roasting coffee, not a day goes by that we don’t discover something new. We have a passion for learning, which is why our crew regularly participates in Roasters Guild workshops, studying topics ranging from thermodynamics to sensory triangulation. Simply put, we’re constantly striving to develop the best flavors possible from our coffees.

We are keenly aware of the many hands it takes to prepare a great cup of coffee. Alfredo Pacas, a third-generation Salvadoran coffee farmer, and a direct trade partner of ours, says it best: “When I taste a great cup of coffee, I stop, because I know that it’s a miracle.”

We travel every year to meet with farmers and taste improvements in cup quality.

These relationships help to broaden our understanding and appreciation for all that goes into making a great cup of coffee.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,UPC: 750339750199,https://www.target.com/p/tony-39-scaf-233-carmelita-medium-roast-ground-coffee-12oz/-/A-52125906#lnk=sametab,2024-08-28T02:22:01.689593-04:00,OK

It takes plenty of sun to dry all the way through the skin and sweet pulp of the coffee fruit to the seeds inside. This is done on well-tended patios, where whole cherries are raked continuously, and also on the trees, where a portion of the pickings are left to dry on the branch. All of our favorite farms also produce coffees by the “pulped natural” method, which involves removing the skin and some of the fruit pulp from the outset, and the “washed” method, which fully removes it, as is the standard in countries like Costa Rica. In Brazil, with lower altitudes and less acidity, we find the typical washed coffee to be somewhat bland.

Cherries are pulped on the farm with a hand-cranked mill, and the seeds hand washed in a basket. Collectors purchase and hull the coffee while still moist and dark grayish-green, removing the parchment shells and allowing the beans to sun-dry only briefly before delivering them to the port of Medan. Along the way, they become fully dry in stages—acquiring their characteristic Sumatran earthiness and complexity. Because each lot might include the beans of 100 different farmers, great Sumatra relies on strong relationships and sharp tasting skills.

From growers, the brothers then started roasting coffee in their estate, Hacienda Buenos Aires, gaining the respect and love of the community. It was also here where Francisco Gaviña was born and raised his 4 children teaching them the art of growing quality coffee and roasting it to perfection. Leaving Cuba during the revolution, Francisco and his family settled in Los Angeles, California returning to the coffee business in 1967 – fulfilling a dream of bringing an authentic taste of home to Latinos everywhere.

Ground Coffee.

DAZBOG Coffee is the realization of the American Dream by two immigrants of the former Soviet Union, Anatoly and Leonid Yuffa. The dream that is now DAZBOG began on a bitter, cold night among the cobblestone streets of Lennigrad. The Yuffa family fled Russia to embark on a new and better life of freedom, democracy and opportunity. Their journey is the legacy of DAZBOG Coffee - bringing the richness of the Russian heritage and traditions to their quest for roasting only the finest quality Arabica beans from coffee estates around the world. Anatoly and Leonid have found a way to honor the past and enjoy the present in a rich-tasting cup of coffee. This is the Dazbog way. A way that applauds free expression by bringing out the unique flavor of every bean. A way that celebrates life itself in each and every cup.

Made with the finest Arabica beans from regions around the world, our coffees are roasted the traditional way. The old-world way. The slow way. Where the rich, smooth taste is everything and every moment counts. True, it's a slow process, not hurried like modern methods, yet one that respects the sweet natural characteristics of each bean. Taking the time to roast coffee the old-world way creates a smoother taste as each bean is allowed to mature and develop, thus making a greater contribution to the overall richness of the blend. DAZBOG's roasting produces a complex taste, one might even say a heartier, wealthier taste. It's old-world Russian craftsmanship you can savor with each cup. So slow down. Take the time. Savor the DAZBOG moment . . . and celebrate the heavenly richness of each bean.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,UPC: 641160120940,https://www.target.com/p/dazbog-svoboda-blend-medium-roast-ground-coffee-11oz/-/A-48630603#lnk=sametab,2024-08-28T03:47:51.920439-04:00,OK

At nearly 6,500 feet elevation in the Oromia Region and West Guji Zone, Akilu produces Typica and other local heirloom varieties (one aptly named simply ""Guji"") under the protection of natural shade trees that include enset (false banana), bamboo, avocado and lastly wanza, which is a multi-purpose, indigenous tree whose leaves are used as fertilizer and wood for fuel, tools and furniture. This coffee is also C.A.F.E. certified as being sustainably grown and processed, a ranking achieved through the evaluation of economic, social and environmental aspects of the coffee production. In the cup you'll find a distinct brightness and a layering of notes of lemonade, pink lady apple, coffee flower, dried eucalyptus, lemon balm and english breakfast tea. Akilu Kassa and his son, Biniam are the chief operators and proud owners of the Bedessa wash station which draws its water from the nearby stream named ""Dhadhatu"". For generations these families have grown and picked from their own 'back-yard' plots, ranging 1-4 acres in size. Incredibly, coffee here flourishes in the wild as a sustainable cash crop along with a variety of mango and banana. Once the coffee cherries are pulped and washed, they're fermented for between 16-48 hours (depending on temperature, cloud cover, etc) and then laid out to sun dry on drying tables where they're stirred regularly and covered when the sun is hottest, from noon to 3:00PM. The Kassa family history with coffee runs deep; a few decades ago his grandfather received a 1,200 acre land grant in Guji during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. Aklilu's father made Guji history in 1995 by founding the very first privately-owned washing station, following many years working as a cherry collections agent. This first wash station by the name of Kassa Chirressa was where Aklilu, then 28, began working for his father, who still operates the mill. ""At that time"" recalls Akilu, ""Guji along with Yirgacheffe, Kochere, and dozens of other now-distinct districts were known as Sidama coffee. As an aside, Hegar Mariam is 186 rough-and-tumble miles from Kenya's northern border. The Guji Zone of Southern Ethiopia borders the lush zones of Sidama and West Arsi to the north, the Bale Zone to the east, and the famous Gedeo Zone to the West. Given their closeness, Guji and Gedeo share many crossover characteristics in coffee processing and production, resulting in similar bright, sparkly coffees with heavy floral notes and an overall delicacy. Coffee production in these zones (and throughout the majority of Ethiopia) is generally achieved by small farm holders and cooperatives and not single estate owners.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,UPC: 857783008071,https://www.target.com/p/mt-whitney-coffee-roasters-organic-ethiopia-guji-ground-coffee-medium-roast-12-oz-340-g/-/A-86977055#lnk=sametab,2024-08-28T06:07:36.188687-04:00,OK

At nearly 6,500 feet elevation in the Oromia Region and West Guji Zone, Akilu produces Typica and other local heirloom varieties (one aptly named simply ""Guji"") under the protection of natural shade trees that include enset (false banana), bamboo, avocado and lastly wanza, which is a multi-purpose, indigenous tree whose leaves are used as fertilizer and wood for fuel, tools and furniture. This coffee is also C.A.F.E. certified as being sustainably grown and processed, a ranking achieved through the evaluation of economic, social and environmental aspects of the coffee production. In the cup you'll find a distinct brightness and a layering of notes of lemonade, pink lady apple, coffee flower, dried eucalyptus, lemon balm and english breakfast tea. Akilu Kassa and his son, Biniam are the chief operators and proud owners of the Bedessa wash station which draws its water from the nearby stream named ""Dhadhatu"". For generations these families have grown and picked from their own 'back-yard' plots, ranging 1-4 acres in size. Incredibly, coffee here flourishes in the wild as a sustainable cash crop along with a variety of mango and banana. Once the coffee cherries are pulped and washed, they're fermented for between 16-48 hours (depending on temperature, cloud cover, etc) and then laid out to sun dry on drying tables where they're stirred regularly and covered when the sun is hottest, from noon to 3:00PM. The Kassa family history with coffee runs deep; a few decades ago his grandfather received a 1,200 acre land grant in Guji during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. Aklilu's father made Guji history in 1995 by founding the very first privately-owned washing station, following many years working as a cherry collections agent. This first wash station by the name of Kassa Chirressa was where Aklilu, then 28, began working for his father, who still operates the mill. ""At that time"" recalls Akilu, ""Guji along with Yirgacheffe, Kochere, and dozens of other now-distinct districts were known as Sidama coffee. As an aside, Hegar Mariam is 186 rough-and-tumble miles from Kenya's northern border. The Guji Zone of Southern Ethiopia borders the lush zones of Sidama and West Arsi to the north, the Bale Zone to the east, and the famous Gedeo Zone to the West. Given their closeness, Guji and Gedeo share many crossover characteristics in coffee processing and production, resulting in similar bright, sparkly coffees with heavy floral notes and an overall delicacy. Coffee production in these zones (and throughout the majority of Ethiopia) is generally achieved by small farm holders and cooperatives and not single estate owners.",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,UPC: 857783008064,https://www.target.com/p/mt-whitney-coffee-roasters-organic-ethiopia-guji-whole-bean-coffee-medium-roast-12-oz-340-g/-/A-86977101#lnk=sametab,2024-08-28T09:31:52.580890-04:00,OK

Pink Pineapple Marine Collagen is manufactured from collagen, the principal protein found in all animal skin and bones. While animal collagen is typically extracted from bovine or porcine skin, our marine collagen is produced from the skins of wild, deep-sea ocean fish such as cod, haddock and pollock. Unlike farm-raised fish and other animals, wild-caught fish have no possibility of being exposed to antibiotics or hormones.
