We believe that mother nature has all the answers, and we aim to bring what she gives us to market in the purest way possible without losing the natural nutrients. Sourcing our melons from small farmers, we cold press the rind and flesh, add a touch of filtered water, and a squeeze of lime juice, and bottle it. That’s it! With superior hydration benefits and delicious taste, WTRMLN WTR naturally contains electrolytes and antioxidants to keep you hydrated and rejuvenated in the best way. Drink it for workouts, as an afternoon pick-me-up, or just to stay hydrated throughout the day!

WTRMLN WTR Original Cold Pressed Juiced Watermelon Water, 12 Oz:

DELICIOUS ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER PLANT BASED WATERS: Like coconut water, WTRMLN WTR is naturally low in sugar (45% less than leading juices), and packed with natural electrolytes, antioxidants and vitamins. But nothing beats the juicy taste of watermelon, and other waters lack the natural Lycopene and L-citrulline found in our tasty beverage. It's nature's perfect sports drink.

GOOD FOR YOU: Each bottle of this superfruit juice is bursting with natural electrolytes, antioxidants and vitamins. How much? More electrolytes and 6x the potassium than leading sports drinks! Plus WTRMLN WTR has two special ingredients: Lycopene and L-citrulline, to make your muscles happy.

NO BAD STUFF: No added sugar, sweeteners, artificial flavors or colors.

MADE COLD, SHIPPED COLD, KEEP COLD: We thoughtfully cold press our watermelons in order to maintain the nutrient efficacy, since heating for pasteurization can destroy them. The extra care is worth to ensure we are bringing the best in taste and quality to you.

GREAT SOLO OR AT A PARTY: WTRMLN WTR is delicious on its own, and is also great in smoothies, mocktail and cocktail recipes. Also a great rehydrator for the morning after!

MELONS WITH A MISSION: We source as many 'ugly melons' as we can, that are juicy and delicious on the inside but a little lumpy or bumpy on the outside, saving them from landfills while supporting American and Dominican Republican farmers.","Nutrition Information
