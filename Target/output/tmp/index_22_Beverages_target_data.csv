Honest seeks to create and promote sustainable, great–tasting beverages with honesty and integrity, which means telling you exactly what’s in every beverage from the get-go.

From the very beginning, Honest has been about something as simple as quenching thirst while being “Just a Tad Sweet.” And while our mission is now about more than just refreshment, we strive to fulfill that original promise with the same care and quality as we did back then.

So, when you choose Honest, you choose a drink that makes a difference. Picking up a juice box means promoting wellness, and a commitment to making sure better options are available to all. Honest strives to deliver on this and its other missions—like democratizing organic ingredients—just like it delivers on high-quality lemonades, teas and juices.

We make our drinks the way you expect from a brand named Honest—organically. Whether you’re looking for the robust variety of our Honest Teas, the refreshing tartness of our Honest Lemonades, or our fun and flavorful Honest Kids juice drinks, Honest has something for the whole family to enjoy.

Refreshingly yours,
