Our Haloumi is made using the highest quality milk from our own farm, situated on the fertile banks of the Murray River at Corowa, NSW.

Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, along with vegetables and meat. Larger cut slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

It is a key ingredient in lasagnas, casseroles, pasta bakes and most other cheesy hot dishes. Simple to use, just grate or slice, and add to your favourite dish. Mozzarella, also from the Pasta Filata family, is lower in moisture than Bocconcini. La Casa Del Formaggio's Mozzarella follows the same manufacturing process as the Bocconcini products, only it is cooked a little longer in its own whey to expel more moisture, making it one of the purest Mozzarellas on the market, with absolutely no artificial preservatives. Our Mozzarella is higher moisture than standard pizza cheese, which means it stays rich and creamy when melted at high temperatures.",,"Per 100g/ml

It is a delicate shell of fresh mozzarella that encases stracciatella. It is a special moment of anticipation for your dinner guests when you press the knife into your Burrata to release the stracciatella from inside the heart of its mozzarella casing. The little shreds of mozzarella that makes up the stracciatella combines with the rich cream to become as soft and milky as it is decadent.
It doesn't matter how you serve it. You can break it over bread, you can break it over a pizza, you can break it over a bed of tomatoes or a salad of roasted vegetables. Whatever way you choose, season it with a little salt, pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. But keep your recipes simple because the burrata is the hero.",,"Per 100g/ml

When ageing, Castello Havarti becomes a little harder than younger Havarti cheeses and develops a pleasant crunch coming from the salty crystals that begin to form.

Our Haloumi is made using the highest quality milk from our own farm, situated on the fertile banks of the Murray River at Corowa, NSW.

Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, along with vegetables and meat. Larger cut slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

Unlike most big-name Parm-in-a-jar, our Coles Grated Parmesan Cheese is crafted with non-animal rennet, which makes it suitable for our vegetarian folk. Our ingredients are simple and free from potassium sorbate, a preservative often added to extend shelf-life and flavour. What you see is what you get, as it were.

Whether you plan to impress at the next BBQ gathering with an warm pumpkin salad or cook an undeniable meatball bolognese, sprinkling (or let's face it, pouring) this parmesan atop will only improve your no doubt excellent culinary creations.

 Low fat
 98 % fat free
 Low in sodium
 Source of protein
 High in calcium
 5 Health Star rated
Available at Woolworths in the long-life milk section.

* One serve contains 0.8g plant sterols, which helps lower cholesterol as part of a healthy and varied diet low in saturated fat and containing 2g plant sterols a day. See pack for more information.

As we age, we are more likely to develop high cholesterol which may lead to heart disease.

Research shows that having foods or drinks enriched with plant sterols can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels, known as the “bad” cholesterol, which is associated with increased risk of heart disease^.

Milk is also a nutrient powerhouse, including protein, calcium and potassium, which can help support overall health and wellness.

^Ras, et al. Br J Nutr, 2014. 112(2): 214-9
What are plant sterols?
Plant sterols are naturally present in plants and have been scientifically proven to help lower total and LDL (Low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol by blocking the absorption of dietary cholesterol in the digestive system.
We have simply added the power of plant sterols to a 5 Health Star rated low fat milk which makes it a convenient and efficient way to take good care of your cholesterol each and everyday.

If you happen to be a barista you will want to know that liquid oats aren't overly sweet or excessively heavy. What they are is fully foamable putting you in total control over the density and performance of your foam so you can showcase your latte art skillz, sorry, we mean skills.You should probably give it a try and see what you think.
If you don't happen to be a barista, that's cool. Just heat this Barista Edition oat milk in a container while giving it a whirl until it foams up nicely and then pour yourself an oat latte. And if you don't feel like a latte you will be happy to know that this product tastes just as amazing if you drink it straight or pour it on your granola or put it to work with your cooking skills. But let's keep that to us non-baristas, okay?

We're pretty passionate about making great tasting products packed with real dairy goodness. We put that devotion into every Pauls milk, cream, custard and yoghurt we make. Milk is a natural source of protein, vitamins and minerals essential for good health. Rich in calcium, Pauls Zymil is simply milk which is easy to digest (As part of a healthy and varied diet, consuming Zymil instead of regular milk helps ease digestion in those who are sensitive to lactose). Plus Pauls Zymil is lactose free and made from real milk so it has all of the natural goodness of regular milk. Lactose free, easy to digest and rich in calcium.

Water, organic oats and a little bit of sea salt for flavour. That's it. Then this product is packaged in a process that allows it to be stored without refrigeration. That means you can take it down to Perisher and store it in the hall and then pop it in the fridge to chill before using. If you are familiar with our other products, we recommend you try this one. It has the potential to win some shelf space in your home.
The non-secret secret? It's all in the oats. 100 % organic oats that are grown in clean soil and spend the summer in peace and quiet to grow strong and golden. And it's totally plant-based aka vegan! That was probably already clear, but we just wanted to make sure everyone's on the same page.

5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.

Pleasantly tart with a hint of natural fizz, our live Natural Probiotic Kefir is made with fresh milk from grass-fed Gippsland cow's milk with no milk powders, just as nature intended.
Being traditionally slow fermented means all the good bits stay inside the bottle. Because our live Probiotic kefir is made with fresh milk and is slow-fermented, it can get a little lumpy (just like life)! Simply give it a good shake to make it deliciously creamy again!
Enjoy as a great alternative to milk and yogurt and is perfectly paired with all your favourite breakfasts. You can use kefir on its own as a nutritious drink, add it to smoothies, dollop onto your favourite muesli or use it in recipes such as pancakes¦ the options are endless.

With 10 culture strains and over 90 billion+ live cultures in every serve, it's a delicious way to create a healthier, happier gut.
Pleasantly tart with a hint of natural fizz, our live Lactose Free Probiotic Kefir is made with fresh milk from grass-fed Gippsland cows with no reconstituted milk powders, just as nature intended.
Being traditionally slow fermented means all the good bits stay inside the bottle. Because our live Probiotic kefir is made with real milk and is slow-fermented, it can get a little lumpy (just like life)! Simply give it a good shake to make it deliciously creamy again!
Kefir is a great alternative to milk and yogurt and our Lactose Free Kefir is perfect as a lactose free substitute. You can use kefir on its own as a nutritious drink, add it to smoothies, dollop onto your favourite muesli or use it in recipes such as pancakes ¦the options are endless.

HeartActive milk tastes delicious, making it the simple and easy way to help manage your cholesterol. Good news for your body, great news for your tastebuds.

Enjoy HeartActive milk on your cereal, in tea and coffee, in a delicious fruit smoothie or in cooking. 

5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.
