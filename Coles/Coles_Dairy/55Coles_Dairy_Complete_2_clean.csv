Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, with vegetables and meat. Larger slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

Typically aged for 12 months for a bold, creamy, caramel flavour, smooth texture and a curious crunch. Something happens when you age a mild, slightly tangy Danish Havarti. When ageing, Castello Havarti becomes a little harder than younger Havarti cheeses and develops a pleasant crunch coming from the salty crystals that begin to form. The cheese's softness thickens and becomes crumbly. Flavours gather like handfuls of crushed almonds and hazelnuts, sweet with a sharp finish.",,"Per 100g/ml

La Casa Del Formaggio's Mozzarella follows the same manufacturing process as the Bocconcini products, only it is cooked a little longer in its own whey to expel more moisture, making it one of the purest Mozzarellas on the market, with absolutely no artificial preservatives. Our Mozzarella is higher moisture than standard pizza cheese, which means it stays rich and creamy when melted at high temperatures.",,"Per 100g/ml

Our Haloumi is made using the highest quality milk from our own farm, situated on the fertile banks of the Murray River at Corowa, NSW.

Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, along with vegetables and meat. Larger cut slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

Our Haloumi is made using the highest quality milk from our own farm, situated on the fertile banks of the Murray River at Corowa, NSW.

Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, along with vegetables and meat. Larger cut slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

Delicious blend of sweet honey, savoury soy and garlic

Cook up a family favourite with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy Garlic Stir Fry Sauce.
This classic combination of garlic, sweet honey and savoury soy packs a flavour punch and is great paired with chicken, beef or pork strips. For a tasty vegetarian option try swapping out the meat for firm fried tofu. You can use any vegetables you have on hand, but broccoli, cauliflower and snow peas are all popular choices.

Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce helps you cut down on meal prep so dinner comes together fast. Just make sure you have all your ingredients ready to go before you fire up the stove because the actual cooking happens quickly. Part of what makes stir fries great is their versatility so feel free to get creative with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce and different veggies and toppings. Serve with Hokkien noodles or fluffy rice.

Coles Kitchen tip: Build even more flavour into your dish with a sprinkling of chopped spring onions and chilli flakes.",,"Per 100g/ml

* One serve contains 0.8g plant sterols, which helps lower cholesterol as part of a healthy and varied diet low in saturated fat and containing 2g plant sterols a day. See pack for more information.

As we age, we are more likely to develop high cholesterol which may lead to heart disease.

Research shows that having foods or drinks enriched with plant sterols can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels, known as the “bad” cholesterol, which is associated with increased risk of heart disease^.

Milk is also a nutrient powerhouse, including protein, calcium and potassium, which can help support overall health and wellness.

^Ras, et al. Br J Nutr, 2014. 112(2): 214-9
What are plant sterols?
Plant sterols are naturally present in plants and have been scientifically proven to help lower total and LDL (Low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol by blocking the absorption of dietary cholesterol in the digestive system.
We have simply added the power of plant sterols to a 5 Health Star rated low fat milk which makes it a convenient and efficient way to take good care of your cholesterol each and everyday.

If you happen to be a barista you will want to know that liquid oats aren't overly sweet or excessively heavy. What they are is fully foamable putting you in total control over the density and performance of your foam so you can showcase your latte art skillz, sorry, we mean skills.You should probably give it a try and see what you think.
If you don't happen to be a barista, that's cool. Just heat this Barista Edition oat milk in a container while giving it a whirl until it foams up nicely and then pour yourself an oat latte. And if you don't feel like a latte you will be happy to know that this product tastes just as amazing if you drink it straight or pour it on your granola or put it to work with your cooking skills. But let's keep that to us non-baristas, okay?

HeartActive milk tastes delicious, making it the simple and easy way to help manage your cholesterol. Good news for your body, great news for your tastebuds.

Enjoy HeartActive milk on your cereal, in tea and coffee, in a delicious fruit smoothie or in cooking. 

5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.

Vegetarian
Traditional sweet and sour sauce
No artificial colours and flavours

Coles Sweet Sour Stir Fry Sauce is a quick and a convenient way to get delicious mid-week meals on the table with no fuss.

This tangy blend of spices is perfectly balanced with sweet pineapple and aromatic herbs providing a refreshing contrast to a variety of ingredients. For protein, chicken or pork strips are classic choices, especially when paired with pineapple chunks and crunchy vegetables like broccoli and carrots. For a tasty meat-free option, try Coles Sweet and Sour Stir Fry Sauce with fried tofu and vegetables to add colour and texture to the dish. Feel free to get creative and customise your stir-fries with whatever ingredients you have on hand.

Serve over noodles or rice and garnish with fresh spring onion and a sprinkling of sesame seeds for a vibrant family-friendly meal that's sure to be a hit.

Chefs Tip: For a spicy twist, add some sliced red chilli or chilli flakes.",,"Per 100g/ml

Delicious blend of sweet honey, savoury soy and garlic

Cook up a family favourite with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy Garlic Stir Fry Sauce.
This classic combination of garlic, sweet honey and savoury soy packs a flavour punch and is great paired with chicken, beef or pork strips. For a tasty vegetarian option try swapping out the meat for firm fried tofu. You can use any vegetables you have on hand, but broccoli, cauliflower and snow peas are all popular choices.

Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce helps you cut down on meal prep so dinner comes together fast. Just make sure you have all your ingredients ready to go before you fire up the stove because the actual cooking happens quickly. Part of what makes stir fries great is their versatility so feel free to get creative with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce and different veggies and toppings. Serve with Hokkien noodles or fluffy rice.

Coles Kitchen tip: Build even more flavour into your dish with a sprinkling of chopped spring onions and chilli flakes.",,"Per 100g/ml

Traditional sweet and sour sauce
No artificial colours and flavours

Coles Sweet Sour Stir Fry Sauce is a quick and a convenient way to get delicious mid-week meals on the table with no fuss.

This tangy blend of spices is perfectly balanced with sweet pineapple and aromatic herbs providing a refreshing contrast to a variety of ingredients. For protein, chicken or pork strips are classic choices, especially when paired with pineapple chunks and crunchy vegetables like broccoli and carrots. For a tasty meat-free option, try Coles Sweet and Sour Stir Fry Sauce with fried tofu and vegetables to add colour and texture to the dish. Feel free to get creative and customise your stir-fries with whatever ingredients you have on hand.

Serve over noodles or rice and garnish with fresh spring onion and a sprinkling of sesame seeds for a vibrant family-friendly meal that's sure to be a hit.

Chefs Tip: For a spicy twist, add some sliced red chilli or chilli flakes.",,"Per 100g/ml

Ready in minutes
No artificial colours and flavours
Delicious blend of sweet honey, savoury soy and garlic

Cook up a family favourite with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy Garlic Stir Fry Sauce.
This classic combination of garlic, sweet honey and savoury soy packs a flavour punch and is great paired with chicken, beef or pork strips. For a tasty vegetarian option try swapping out the meat for firm fried tofu. You can use any vegetables you have on hand, but broccoli, cauliflower and snow peas are all popular choices.

Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce helps you cut down on meal prep so dinner comes together fast. Just make sure you have all your ingredients ready to go before you fire up the stove because the actual cooking happens quickly. Part of what makes stir fries great is their versatility so feel free to get creative with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce and different veggies and toppings. Serve with Hokkien noodles or fluffy rice.

Coles Kitchen tip: Build even more flavour into your dish with a sprinkling of chopped spring onions and chilli flakes.",,"Per 100g/ml
