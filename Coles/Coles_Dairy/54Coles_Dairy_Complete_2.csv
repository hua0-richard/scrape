It has the same full flavour as standard haloumi- just without the lactose.

Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, with vegetables and meat. Larger slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

Our Haloumi is made using the highest quality milk from our own farm, situated on the fertile banks of the Murray River at Corowa, NSW.

Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, along with vegetables and meat. Larger cut slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

Our Haloumi is made using the highest quality milk from our own farm, situated on the fertile banks of the Murray River at Corowa, NSW.

Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, along with vegetables and meat. Larger cut slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

Coles Sweet Sour Stir Fry Sauce is a quick and a convenient way to get delicious mid-week meals on the table with no fuss.

This tangy blend of spices is perfectly balanced with sweet pineapple and aromatic herbs providing a refreshing contrast to a variety of ingredients. For protein, chicken or pork strips are classic choices, especially when paired with pineapple chunks and crunchy vegetables like broccoli and carrots. For a tasty meat-free option, try Coles Sweet and Sour Stir Fry Sauce with fried tofu and vegetables to add colour and texture to the dish. Feel free to get creative and customise your stir-fries with whatever ingredients you have on hand.

Serve over noodles or rice and garnish with fresh spring onion and a sprinkling of sesame seeds for a vibrant family-friendly meal that's sure to be a hit.

Chefs Tip: For a spicy twist, add some sliced red chilli or chilli flakes.",,,"Per 100g/ml

Delicious blend of sweet honey, savoury soy and garlic

Cook up a family favourite with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy Garlic Stir Fry Sauce.
This classic combination of garlic, sweet honey and savoury soy packs a flavour punch and is great paired with chicken, beef or pork strips. For a tasty vegetarian option try swapping out the meat for firm fried tofu. You can use any vegetables you have on hand, but broccoli, cauliflower and snow peas are all popular choices.

Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce helps you cut down on meal prep so dinner comes together fast. Just make sure you have all your ingredients ready to go before you fire up the stove because the actual cooking happens quickly. Part of what makes stir fries great is their versatility so feel free to get creative with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce and different veggies and toppings. Serve with Hokkien noodles or fluffy rice.

Coles Kitchen tip: Build even more flavour into your dish with a sprinkling of chopped spring onions and chilli flakes.",,,"Per 100g/ml

Available at Woolworths in the long-life milk section.

* One serve contains 0.8g plant sterols, which helps lower cholesterol as part of a healthy and varied diet low in saturated fat and containing 2g plant sterols a day. See pack for more information.

As we age, we are more likely to develop high cholesterol which may lead to heart disease.

Research shows that having foods or drinks enriched with plant sterols can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels, known as the “bad” cholesterol, which is associated with increased risk of heart disease^.

Milk is also a nutrient powerhouse, including protein, calcium and potassium, which can help support overall health and wellness.

^Ras, et al. Br J Nutr, 2014. 112(2): 214-9
What are plant sterols?
Plant sterols are naturally present in plants and have been scientifically proven to help lower total and LDL (Low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol by blocking the absorption of dietary cholesterol in the digestive system.
We have simply added the power of plant sterols to a 5 Health Star rated low fat milk which makes it a convenient and efficient way to take good care of your cholesterol each and everyday.

Our beautiful jersey girls are the reason we are creme de la creme of all milks. Jersey milk is renowned for its rich creaminess, higher levels of protein - including the A2 Protein and is seriously delicious!Milk is one of the best sources of calcium as well as many vitamins and minerals - like Vitamin A, E and D, magnesium and potassium. But did you know that milk from Jersey cows is even better? It has a higher protein content and is naturally higher in nutrients and vitamins. On average Jersey milk has 20% more calcium and 18% more protein than most other milks.Our cows are purebred heritage breed originating from the British Isle of Jersey, with naturally superior milk. Because our beautiful cows largely graze on Gippsland's lush green grass their milk also contains more omega-3s and beneficial fatty acids than milk from other cows. In fact, Jersey milk is even often better tolerated by lactose intolerant people because it mostly contains A2 protein which is easier on our digestive system! There is so much to love about our milk, and its great taste is simply one small reason! Gippsland Jersey proudly does things differently, sourcing milk from smaller, family farms with incredible dairy farmers paying farmers a fair price for what they produce. By sidestepping large milk processors and value-adding already premium jersey local milk, we ensure a healthy wage for farmers and a clear choice for consumers.And by manufacturing in regional Victoria (Lakes Entrance) it keeps the dollars local, as well as delivering random acts of kindness to the Gippsland farming community, and creating social change in rural mental health by championing emotional wellbeing of dairy farmers who may be struggling.",,,,,https://www.coles.com.au/product/gippsland-jersey-full-cream-milk-2l-4201117,,,2024-06-17T17:02:07.482843-04:00

Pleasantly tart with a hint of natural fizz, our live Natural Probiotic Kefir is made with fresh milk from grass-fed Gippsland cow's milk with no milk powders, just as nature intended.
Being traditionally slow fermented means all the good bits stay inside the bottle. Because our live Probiotic kefir is made with fresh milk and is slow-fermented, it can get a little lumpy (just like life)! Simply give it a good shake to make it deliciously creamy again!
Enjoy as a great alternative to milk and yogurt and is perfectly paired with all your favourite breakfasts. You can use kefir on its own as a nutritious drink, add it to smoothies, dollop onto your favourite muesli or use it in recipes such as pancakes¦ the options are endless.

HeartActive milk tastes delicious, making it the simple and easy way to help manage your cholesterol. Good news for your body, great news for your tastebuds.

Enjoy HeartActive milk on your cereal, in tea and coffee, in a delicious fruit smoothie or in cooking. 

5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.

We've hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cerrado region of Brazil where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has nutty and bright citrus notes, with a caramel finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cerrado coffee beans are informed by the region's special terroir.
With rich soils and high altitudes, Cerrado produces a clean bean that translates into a well-balanced coffee in body and acidity.
The region's moderate continental climate adds to a robust growing season, which is reflected in our Hunt and Brew Brazil blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

We've hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cerrado region of Brazil where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has nutty and bright citrus notes, with a caramel finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cerrado coffee beans are informed by the region's special terroir.
With rich soils and high altitudes, Cerrado produces a clean bean that translates into a well-balanced coffee in body and acidity.
The region's moderate continental climate adds to a robust growing season, which is reflected in our Hunt and Brew Brazil blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

With 10 culture strains and over 90 billion+ live cultures in every serve, it's a delicious way to create a healthier, happier gut.
Pleasantly tart with a hint of natural fizz, our live Natural Probiotic Kefir is made with fresh milk from grass-fed Gippsland cow's milk with no milk powders, just as nature intended.
Being traditionally slow fermented means all the good bits stay inside the bottle. Because our live Probiotic kefir is made with fresh milk and is slow-fermented, it can get a little lumpy (just like life)! Simply give it a good shake to make it deliciously creamy again!
Enjoy as a great alternative to milk and yogurt and is perfectly paired with all your favourite breakfasts. You can use kefir on its own as a nutritious drink, add it to smoothies, dollop onto your favourite muesli or use it in recipes such as pancakes¦ the options are endless.

HeartActive milk tastes delicious, making it the simple and easy way to help manage your cholesterol. Good news for your body, great news for your tastebuds.

Enjoy HeartActive milk on your cereal, in tea and coffee, in a delicious fruit smoothie or in cooking. 

5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.
