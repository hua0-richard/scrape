Jersey milk is renowned for its rich creaminess, higher levels of protein - including the A2 Protein and is seriously delicious!Milk is one of the best sources of calcium as well as many vitamins and minerals - like Vitamin A, E and D, magnesium and potassium. But did you know that milk from Jersey cows is even better? It has a higher protein content and is naturally higher in nutrients and vitamins. On average Jersey milk has 20% more calcium and 18% more protein than most other milks.Our cows are purebred heritage breed originating from the British Isle of Jersey, with naturally superior milk. Because our beautiful cows largely graze on Gippsland's lush green grass their milk also contains more omega-3s and beneficial fatty acids than milk from other cows. In fact, Jersey milk is even often better tolerated by lactose intolerant people because it mostly contains A2 protein which is easier on our digestive system! There is so much to love about our milk, and its great taste is simply one small reason! Gippsland Jersey proudly does things differently, sourcing milk from smaller, family farms with incredible dairy farmers paying farmers a fair price for what they produce. By sidestepping large milk processors and value-adding already premium jersey local milk, we ensure a healthy wage for farmers and a clear choice for consumers.And by manufacturing in regional Victoria (Lakes Entrance) it keeps the dollars local, as well as delivering random acts of kindness to the Gippsland farming community, and creating social change in rural mental health by championing emotional wellbeing of dairy farmers who may be struggling.",,,,,https://www.coles.com.au/product/gippsland-jersey-full-cream-milk-2l-4201117,,,2024-06-17T17:02:07.482843-04:00

Being traditionally slow fermented means all the good bits stay inside the bottle. Because our live Probiotic kefir is made with fresh milk and is slow-fermented, it can get a little lumpy (just like life)! Simply give it a good shake to make it deliciously creamy again!

HeartActive milk tastes delicious, making it the simple and easy way to help manage your cholesterol. Good news for your body, great news for your tastebuds.

Enjoy HeartActive milk on your cereal, in tea and coffee, in a delicious fruit smoothie or in cooking. 

5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.

We've hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cerrado region of Brazil where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has nutty and bright citrus notes, with a caramel finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cerrado coffee beans are informed by the region's special terroir.
With rich soils and high altitudes, Cerrado produces a clean bean that translates into a well-balanced coffee in body and acidity.
The region's moderate continental climate adds to a robust growing season, which is reflected in our Hunt and Brew Brazil blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

We've hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cerrado region of Brazil where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has nutty and bright citrus notes, with a caramel finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cerrado coffee beans are informed by the region's special terroir.
With rich soils and high altitudes, Cerrado produces a clean bean that translates into a well-balanced coffee in body and acidity.
The region's moderate continental climate adds to a robust growing season, which is reflected in our Hunt and Brew Brazil blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

Enjoy HeartActive milk on your cereal, in tea and coffee, in a delicious fruit smoothie or in cooking. 

5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.
