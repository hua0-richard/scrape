Enjoy HeartActive milk on your cereal, in tea and coffee, in a delicious fruit smoothie or in cooking. 

5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.
