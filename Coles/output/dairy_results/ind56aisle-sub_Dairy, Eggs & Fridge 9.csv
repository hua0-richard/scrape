Our hunt has taken us to La Union in the Narino region of Colombia where the high altitude, soil and climate conditions produce a soft brew that has citrus and sweet notes, with a smoky finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
La Unión's close proximity to the equator means coffee beans can be grown at a relatively high altitude of up to 1900m above sea level. 
Blessed with such a diverse climate, La Unión coffee is characterised by rich chocolate tones that are balanced and sweet.
Coffee from this region is washed, with the fruit skin and pulp manually removed from the beans after harvesting and before drying.
The result is the unique flavour found in our Hunt and Brew Colombia blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

We've hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cerrado region of Brazil where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has nutty and bright citrus notes, with a caramel finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cerrado coffee beans are informed by the region's special terroir.
With rich soils and high altitudes, Cerrado produces a clean bean that translates into a well-balanced coffee in body and acidity.
The region's moderate continental climate adds to a robust growing season, which is reflected in our Hunt and Brew Brazil blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.

Pleasantly tart with a hint of natural fizz, our live Lactose Free Probiotic Kefir is made with fresh milk from grass-fed Gippsland cows with no reconstituted milk powders, just as nature intended.
Being traditionally slow fermented means all the good bits stay inside the bottle. Because our live Probiotic kefir is made with real milk and is slow-fermented, it can get a little lumpy (just like life)! Simply give it a good shake to make it deliciously creamy again!
Kefir is a great alternative to milk and yogurt and our Lactose Free Kefir is perfect as a lactose free substitute. You can use kefir on its own as a nutritious drink, add it to smoothies, dollop onto your favourite muesli or use it in recipes such as pancakes ¦the options are endless.

Our hunt has taken us to La Union in the Narino region of Colombia where the high altitude, soil and climate conditions produce a soft brew that has citrus and sweet notes, with a smoky finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
La Unión's close proximity to the equator means coffee beans can be grown at a relatively high altitude of up to 1900m above sea level. 
Blessed with such a diverse climate, La Unión coffee is characterised by rich chocolate tones that are balanced and sweet.
Coffee from this region is washed, with the fruit skin and pulp manually removed from the beans after harvesting and before drying.
The result is the unique flavour found in our Hunt and Brew Colombia blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

We've hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cerrado region of Brazil where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has nutty and bright citrus notes, with a caramel finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cerrado coffee beans are informed by the region's special terroir.
With rich soils and high altitudes, Cerrado produces a clean bean that translates into a well-balanced coffee in body and acidity.
The region's moderate continental climate adds to a robust growing season, which is reflected in our Hunt and Brew Brazil blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

Pleasantly tart with a hint of natural fizz, our live Natural Probiotic Kefir is made with fresh milk from grass-fed Gippsland cow's milk with no milk powders, just as nature intended.
Being traditionally slow fermented means all the good bits stay inside the bottle. Because our live Probiotic kefir is made with fresh milk and is slow-fermented, it can get a little lumpy (just like life)! Simply give it a good shake to make it deliciously creamy again!
Enjoy as a great alternative to milk and yogurt and is perfectly paired with all your favourite breakfasts. You can use kefir on its own as a nutritious drink, add it to smoothies, dollop onto your favourite muesli or use it in recipes such as pancakes¦ the options are endless.
