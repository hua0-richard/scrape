Our Haloumi is made using the highest quality milk from our own farm, situated on the fertile banks of the Murray River at Corowa, NSW.

Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, along with vegetables and meat. Larger cut slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

Mozzarella, also from the Pasta Filata family, is lower in moisture than Bocconcini. La Casa Del Formaggio's Mozzarella follows the same manufacturing process as the Bocconcini products, only it is cooked a little longer in its own whey to expel more moisture, making it one of the purest Mozzarellas on the market, with absolutely no artificial preservatives. Our Mozzarella is higher moisture than standard pizza cheese, which means it stays rich and creamy when melted at high temperatures.",,,"Per 100g/ml

It is a delicate shell of fresh mozzarella that encases stracciatella.

The little shreds of mozzarella that makes up the stracciatella combines with the rich cream to become as soft and milky as it is decadent.
It doesn't matter how you serve it. You can break it over bread, you can break it over a pizza, you can break it over a bed of tomatoes or a salad of roasted vegetables. Whatever way you choose, season it with a little salt, pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. But keep your recipes simple because the burrata is the hero.",,,"Per 100g/ml

Our Haloumi is made using the highest quality milk from our own farm, situated on the fertile banks of the Murray River at Corowa, NSW.

Haloumi Cheese is a semi-hard stretched curd cheese. It has a high melting point, so can easily be fried or grilled without melting. Its salty flavour and unique texture is delicious when barbequed, with a squeeze of lemon or added to salads or skewers, along with vegetables and meat. Larger cut slices are great on burgers or it can be used in baking as a grated cheese on potatoes or pizzas. Endless possibilities!

Unlike most big-name Parm-in-a-jar, our Coles Grated Parmesan Cheese is crafted with non-animal rennet, which makes it suitable for our vegetarian folk. Our ingredients are simple and free from potassium sorbate, a preservative often added to extend shelf-life and flavour. What you see is what you get, as it were.

Whether you plan to impress at the next BBQ gathering with an warm pumpkin salad or cook an undeniable meatball bolognese, sprinkling (or let's face it, pouring) this parmesan atop will only improve your no doubt excellent culinary creations.
