With only 3 natural ingredients, our award winning all-natural Greek Yoghurt is made without the need for stabilisers. Fresh milk and a generous amount of cream is fermented with live cultures to produce a full-bodied, smooth yoghurt with the perfect amount of tang.

With only 3 natural ingredients, our award winning all-natural Greek Yoghurt is made without the need for stabilisers. Fresh milk and a generous amount of cream is fermented with live cultures to produce a full-bodied, smooth yoghurt with the perfect amount of tang.
