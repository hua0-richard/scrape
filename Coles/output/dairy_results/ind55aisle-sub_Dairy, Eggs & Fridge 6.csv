Delicious blend of sweet honey, savoury soy and garlic

Cook up a family favourite with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy Garlic Stir Fry Sauce.
This classic combination of garlic, sweet honey and savoury soy packs a flavour punch and is great paired with chicken, beef or pork strips. For a tasty vegetarian option try swapping out the meat for firm fried tofu. You can use any vegetables you have on hand, but broccoli, cauliflower and snow peas are all popular choices.

Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce helps you cut down on meal prep so dinner comes together fast. Just make sure you have all your ingredients ready to go before you fire up the stove because the actual cooking happens quickly. Part of what makes stir fries great is their versatility so feel free to get creative with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce and different veggies and toppings. Serve with Hokkien noodles or fluffy rice.

Coles Kitchen tip: Build even more flavour into your dish with a sprinkling of chopped spring onions and chilli flakes.",,,"Per 100g/ml
