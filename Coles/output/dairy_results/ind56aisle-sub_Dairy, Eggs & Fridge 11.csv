Ready in minutes
No artificial colours and flavours
Delicious blend of sweet honey, savoury soy and garlic

Cook up a family favourite with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy Garlic Stir Fry Sauce.
This classic combination of garlic, sweet honey and savoury soy packs a flavour punch and is great paired with chicken, beef or pork strips. For a tasty vegetarian option try swapping out the meat for firm fried tofu. You can use any vegetables you have on hand, but broccoli, cauliflower and snow peas are all popular choices.

Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce helps you cut down on meal prep so dinner comes together fast. Just make sure you have all your ingredients ready to go before you fire up the stove because the actual cooking happens quickly. Part of what makes stir fries great is their versatility so feel free to get creative with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce and different veggies and toppings. Serve with Hokkien noodles or fluffy rice.

Coles Kitchen tip: Build even more flavour into your dish with a sprinkling of chopped spring onions and chilli flakes.",,,"Per 100g/ml

Traditional sweet and sour sauce
No artificial colours and flavours

Coles Sweet Sour Stir Fry Sauce is a quick and a convenient way to get delicious mid-week meals on the table with no fuss.

This tangy blend of spices is perfectly balanced with sweet pineapple and aromatic herbs providing a refreshing contrast to a variety of ingredients. For protein, chicken or pork strips are classic choices, especially when paired with pineapple chunks and crunchy vegetables like broccoli and carrots. For a tasty meat-free option, try Coles Sweet and Sour Stir Fry Sauce with fried tofu and vegetables to add colour and texture to the dish. Feel free to get creative and customise your stir-fries with whatever ingredients you have on hand.

Serve over noodles or rice and garnish with fresh spring onion and a sprinkling of sesame seeds for a vibrant family-friendly meal that's sure to be a hit.

Chefs Tip: For a spicy twist, add some sliced red chilli or chilli flakes.",,,"Per 100g/ml

Traditional sweet and sour sauce
No artificial colours and flavours

Coles Sweet Sour Stir Fry Sauce is a quick and a convenient way to get delicious mid-week meals on the table with no fuss.

This tangy blend of spices is perfectly balanced with sweet pineapple and aromatic herbs providing a refreshing contrast to a variety of ingredients. For protein, chicken or pork strips are classic choices, especially when paired with pineapple chunks and crunchy vegetables like broccoli and carrots. For a tasty meat-free option, try Coles Sweet and Sour Stir Fry Sauce with fried tofu and vegetables to add colour and texture to the dish. Feel free to get creative and customise your stir-fries with whatever ingredients you have on hand.

Serve over noodles or rice and garnish with fresh spring onion and a sprinkling of sesame seeds for a vibrant family-friendly meal that's sure to be a hit.

Chefs Tip: For a spicy twist, add some sliced red chilli or chilli flakes.",,,"Per 100g/ml

No artificial colours and flavours
Delicious blend of sweet honey, savoury soy and garlic

Cook up a family favourite with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy Garlic Stir Fry Sauce.
This classic combination of garlic, sweet honey and savoury soy packs a flavour punch and is great paired with chicken, beef or pork strips. For a tasty vegetarian option try swapping out the meat for firm fried tofu. You can use any vegetables you have on hand, but broccoli, cauliflower and snow peas are all popular choices.

Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce helps you cut down on meal prep so dinner comes together fast. Just make sure you have all your ingredients ready to go before you fire up the stove because the actual cooking happens quickly. Part of what makes stir fries great is their versatility so feel free to get creative with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce and different veggies and toppings. Serve with Hokkien noodles or fluffy rice.

Coles Kitchen tip: Build even more flavour into your dish with a sprinkling of chopped spring onions and chilli flakes.",,,"Per 100g/ml
