Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce helps you cut down on meal prep so dinner comes together fast. Just make sure you have all your ingredients ready to go before you fire up the stove because the actual cooking happens quickly. Part of what makes stir fries great is their versatility so feel free to get creative with Coles Kitchen Honey, Soy and Garlic Stir Fry Sauce and different veggies and toppings. Serve with Hokkien noodles or fluffy rice.
