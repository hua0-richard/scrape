5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.

With 10 culture strains and over 90 billion+ live cultures in every serve, it's a delicious way to create a healthier, happier gut.
Pleasantly tart with a hint of natural fizz, our live Natural Probiotic Kefir is made with fresh milk from grass-fed Gippsland cow's milk with no milk powders, just as nature intended.
Being traditionally slow fermented means all the good bits stay inside the bottle. Because our live Probiotic kefir is made with fresh milk and is slow-fermented, it can get a little lumpy (just like life)! Simply give it a good shake to make it deliciously creamy again!
Enjoy as a great alternative to milk and yogurt and is perfectly paired with all your favourite breakfasts. You can use kefir on its own as a nutritious drink, add it to smoothies, dollop onto your favourite muesli or use it in recipes such as pancakes¦ the options are endless.

With 10 culture strains and over 90 billion+ live cultures in every serve, it's a delicious way to create a healthier, happier gut.
Pleasantly tart with a hint of natural fizz, our live Lactose Free Probiotic Kefir is made with fresh milk from grass-fed Gippsland cows with no reconstituted milk powders, just as nature intended.
Being traditionally slow fermented means all the good bits stay inside the bottle. Because our live Probiotic kefir is made with real milk and is slow-fermented, it can get a little lumpy (just like life)! Simply give it a good shake to make it deliciously creamy again!
Kefir is a great alternative to milk and yogurt and our Lactose Free Kefir is perfect as a lactose free substitute. You can use kefir on its own as a nutritious drink, add it to smoothies, dollop onto your favourite muesli or use it in recipes such as pancakes ¦the options are endless.

Enjoy HeartActive milk on your cereal, in tea and coffee, in a delicious fruit smoothie or in cooking. 

5 health star rating. 

Proud supporters of our Australian dairy farming communities for over 120 years, choose high quality, nutritious and delicious milk from Dairy Farmers.

Studies show that consuming milk with plant sterols every day, like HeartActive, can reduce LDL cholesterol after a minimum of three weeks. The highest study reported an average reduction of greater than 10%, and the overall reduction across these studies was 8.53%. Results may vary depending on personal circumstances. For best results, enjoy 2g of plant sterols (2-3 serves of HeartActive milk), as part of a healthy diet, low in saturated fat. More than 3 serves a day provides no additional health benefits. For children under the age of five, pregnant or lactating women and people taking cholesterol-lowering medication, doctor's advice should be sought before using HeartActive, due to their special dietary needs.
