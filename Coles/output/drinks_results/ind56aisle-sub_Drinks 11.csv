Often known as Temple of Heaven, this special gunpowder tea (locally referred to as Zhu Cha or pearl tea) is grown in the beautiful mountainous province of Zhejiang.

Here dramatic seasons, with humid summers and bitter frosts melting to a vibrant spring flush, nurture the tea leaves' flavour. The plucked leaves are then tightly rolled to protect their smooth, mellow flavour.

Our Chinese Green tea is grassy with a nutty sweetness and a delicate, lingering flavour.
Chinese culture has revered green tea for millennia for its perceived benefits. More information on our Chinese Green tea can be found on our website.

Our plant-based pyramid-shaped tea bags are generously sized to allow the rolled leaves to unfurl and fully infuse. Each tea bag comes in a recyclable envelope so the leaves stay as fresh as the first day they were picked and your cup of tea delivers joy every time.

96 is only possible because of the communities that nurture the verdant lands where our teas grow.

Chamomile has been valued through the ages for its perceived properties. More information on our Chamomile tea can be found on our website.
