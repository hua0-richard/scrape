S.PELLEGRINO Sparkling Natural Mineral Water has a unique blend of minerals, fine bubbles and subtle nuances. It is one of the most renowned waters globally and a perfect accompaniment to some of the world's finest ingredients. It flows from natural springs in Val Brembana in the San Pellegrino Terme area, at the foothills of the Italian Alps, near Bergamo and evokes the quintessential Italian way of living in every bottle.

These elegant glass bottle is perfect for any occasion and is best served with good friends, close family and great food. Because nothing inspires a spirit of togetherness quite like S.PELLEGRINO.

Since its foundation in 1899 S.PELLEGRINO has been an iconic symbol of Italian style, fine food and fine living. It's there to refresh those precious moments shared with friends and family at home. It stands proudly on tables of some of the world's most famous restaurants, and it does it all with that certain sparkling style and typical Italian elegance.

S.Pellegrino spreads a distinct taste of Italy around the world; a taste of a place where every moment is considered precious. The unique taste of S.Pellegrino mineral water is the product of a natural journey that takes place in the dolomitic mountains overlooking Brembo River valley. It's here, in the untouched lands of Italy's Northwestern Alps that S.Pellegrino begins its 30-year-journey inside the earth. During this journey the water flows slowly through the different rock formations collecting minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium as it goes that create the unmistakable taste of S.PELLEGRINO Sparkling Natural Mineral Water.

S.PELLEGRINO Sparkling Natural Mineral Water has a unique blend of minerals, fine bubbles and subtle nuances. It is one of the most renowned waters globally and a perfect accompaniment to some of the world's finest ingredients. It flows from natural springs in Val Brembana in the San Pellegrino Terme area, at the foothills of the Italian Alps, near Bergamo and evokes the quintessential Italian way of living in every bottle.

1 Litre plastic bottle is the ideal size for sharing with friends at home. Because nothing inspires a spirit of togetherness quite like S.PELLEGRINO.

Since its foundation in 1899 S.PELLEGRINO has been an iconic symbol of Italian style, fine food and fine living. It's there to refresh those precious moments shared with friends and family at home. It stands proudly on tables of some of the world's most famous restaurants, and it does it all with that certain sparkling style and typical Italian elegance.

S.Pellegrino spreads a distinct taste of Italy around the world; a taste of a place where every moment is considered precious. The unique taste of S.Pellegrino mineral water is the product of a natural journey that takes place in the dolomitic mountains overlooking Brembo River valley. It's here, in the untouched lands of Italy's Northwestern Alps that S.Pellegrino begins its 30-year-journey inside the earth. During this journey the water flows slowly through the different rock formations collecting minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium as it goes that create the unmistakable taste of S.PELLEGRINO Sparkling Natural Mineral Water.

S.PELLEGRINO Sparkling Natural Mineral Water has a unique blend of minerals, fine bubbles and subtle nuances. It is one of the most renowned waters globally and a perfect accompaniment to some of the world's finest ingredients. It flows from natural springs in Val Brembana in the San Pellegrino Terme area, at the foothills of the Italian Alps, near Bergamo and evokes the quintessential Italian way of living in every bottle.

This 6-pack comes with a convenient carry handle, and these 1 Litre plastic bottle are the ideal size for sharing with friends at home. Because nothing inspires a spirit of togetherness quite like S.PELLEGRINO.

Since its foundation in 1899 S.PELLEGRINO has been an iconic symbol of Italian style, fine food and fine living. It's there to refresh those precious moments shared with friends and family at home. It stands proudly on tables of some of the world's most famous restaurants, and it does it all with that certain sparkling style and typical Italian elegance.

S.Pellegrino spreads a distinct taste of Italy around the world; a taste of a place where every moment is considered precious. The unique taste of S.Pellegrino mineral water is the product of a natural journey that takes place in the dolomitic mountains overlooking Brembo River valley. It's here, in the untouched lands of Italy's Northwestern Alps that S.Pellegrino begins its 30-year-journey inside the earth. During this journey the water flows slowly through the different rock formations collecting minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium as it goes that create the unmistakable taste of S.PELLEGRINO Sparkling Natural Mineral Water.

aka+ is healthy, refreshing and tastes incredible! This is all thanks to the advanced technology used to create aka+.

What makes aka+ different to many alkaline waters is the unique ionisation process - it raises the pH of the water and removes bitter ions, which can occur in water with a higher pH.

aka+ is also purified using both microfiltration and reverse osmosis and has added electrolytes to give it an even better taste.

While most bottled waters have a pH of 5-8, aka+ has a pH of 9.5+. So, if you're looking for a truly alkaline water, aka+ delivers.
