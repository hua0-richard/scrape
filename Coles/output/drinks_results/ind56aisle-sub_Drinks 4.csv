We've hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cerrado region of Brazil where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has nutty and bright citrus notes, with a caramel finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cerrado coffee beans are informed by the region's special terroir.
With rich soils and high altitudes, Cerrado produces a clean bean that translates into a well-balanced coffee in body and acidity.
The region's moderate continental climate adds to a robust growing season, which is reflected in our Hunt and Brew Brazil blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

Similarly to the local hunter of the region, our Australian crocodiles, who stalk and snatch their prey, that's how we feel about choosing the right coffee bean â single minded in the pursuit of the perfect brew.
Locally roasted and ground, we slowly brew and triple filter our coffee for maximum flavour extraction. Finally we cut the brew with fresh full cream milk and nothing else. The result is notes of macadamia and mandarin with a milk chocolate finish.",,,"Per 100g/ml
