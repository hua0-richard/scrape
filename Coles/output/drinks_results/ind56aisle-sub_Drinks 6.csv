We watched on helplessly as a fire burnt down our factory full of fruit, juice and jobs. Some brave firemen (to whom we're eternally grateful) managed to save the shell of nudie HQ, but the inside was as gutted as we were. A dire nudie drought followed and fans were left to lick at the leftovers on their lids for six long weeks. But heads, hearts and hands combined and nudie rose triumphantly from the embers to blend fruit once more.
Are you a fireman? Pop into nudie HQ to say hi (we will give you a free nudie)!

Naming nudie was actually a reasonably straightforward job. We needed something that said it was blended fruit and nothing else. When 'naked fruit' was deemed too saucy, someone suggested 'nudie'. We liked the idea of answering the phone welcome to nudie and the URL was (inexplicably) available so nudie was named! We created some characters and the nudie label was ready to be popped onto bottles for fruit fans far and wide. We did good that day. Got any good you've created today? creatorsofgood@nudie.com.au
