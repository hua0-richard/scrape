Often known as Temple of Heaven, this special gunpowder tea (locally referred to as Zhu Cha or pearl tea) is grown in the beautiful mountainous province of Zhejiang.

Here dramatic seasons, with humid summers and bitter frosts melting to a vibrant spring flush, nurture the tea leaves' flavour. The plucked leaves are then tightly rolled to protect their smooth, mellow flavour.

Our Chinese Green tea is grassy with a nutty sweetness and a delicate, lingering flavour.
Chinese culture has revered green tea for millennia for its perceived benefits. More information on our Chinese Green tea can be found on our website.

Our plant-based pyramid-shaped tea bags are generously sized to allow the rolled leaves to unfurl and fully infuse. Each tea bag comes in a recyclable envelope so the leaves stay as fresh as the first day they were picked and your cup of tea delivers joy every time.

96 is only possible because of the communities that nurture the verdant lands where our teas grow.

Just imagine three types of mint together - finely-chopped spearmint, fieldmint and peppermint - the cool suddenly becomes more vibrant. The sweetness more supreme. And the 'you' it leaves behind, as crisp and clean as the brightest day. Good News for refreshing the palate.

Infuse for up to 15 minutes. Boiling just the water you need helps make every cup of Pukka tea as sustainable as it can be. Every Pukka plastic-free tea bag comes in its own recyclable envelope to retain the essential oils in our organic herbs. Each bag has two chambers, allowing these incredible herbs to flow and release the full potency in your cup. To help the flavours to fully disperse, pour boiling water directly on the bag. Every herb loves the water, so leave them to steep for the perfect brew. And remember to boil just the amount of water you need to make your cuppa as environmentally-friendly as it can be. Deliciousness knows no deeper colour.

At Pukka, our heartfelt desire is to create a healthier, happier world through the incredible power of organic herbs. We hope you feel inspired to discover more about yourself and the beautiful planet on which we all live. Doing good things helps make good things happen. We create things that help you, help nature and everything in-between.

Accompanying breakfasts since the early 19th century, this blend is said to have been created by a Scottish tea master named Drysdale. It became known as “English” tea as it was a favourite of Queen Victoria. Blended teas were almost unheard of at the time - making English Breakfast eye-opening in more ways than one. Sticking with this tradition, we balance Assam Orthodox and CTC teas with Ceylon teas to deliver the perfect English Breakfast. We don't stop at breakfast though, this soul-reviving tea is served all the way to the afternoon and sometimes beyond.

Our English Breakfast tea is a wonderful blend of full bodied and malty Assam teas, with a citrusy Ceylon kick.
Black tea is enjoyed by many cultures from around the world for its perceived benefits. More information on our English Breakfast tea can be found on our website.

Our plant-based pyramid-shaped tea bags are generously sized to allow the leaves to unfurl and fully infuse. Each tea bag comes in a recyclable envelope so the leaves stay as fresh as the first day they were picked and your cup of tea delivers joy every time.

Often known as Temple of Heaven, this special gunpowder tea (locally referred to as Zhu Cha or pearl tea) is grown in the beautiful mountainous province of Zhejiang.

Here dramatic seasons, with humid summers and bitter frosts melting to a vibrant spring flush, nurture the tea leaves' flavour. The plucked leaves are then tightly rolled to protect their smooth, mellow flavour.

Our Chinese Green tea is grassy with a nutty sweetness and a delicate, lingering flavour.
Chinese culture has revered green tea for millennia for its perceived benefits. More information on our Chinese Green tea can be found on our website.

Our plant-based pyramid-shaped tea bags are generously sized to allow the rolled leaves to unfurl and fully infuse. Each tea bag comes in a recyclable envelope so the leaves stay as fresh as the first day they were picked and your cup of tea delivers joy every time.

96 is only possible because of the communities that nurture the verdant lands where our teas grow.

Bright and daisy-like, this fragrant Mediterranean native, is like summer itself. It blooms in light, drained soil in great sweeps by the sea, often on rocky hillsides during southern and eastern Europe's long summer days and cool nights.

Traditionally seen as a symbol of purity, protection and tranquillity, it was also cultivated for a spectrum of perceived benefits. It is caffeine-free, soothing and comfort in a cup.

This Chamomile tea is serenely floral, with a relaxing honeyed note and sweet-apple finish.
Chamomile has been valued through the ages for its perceived properties. More information on our Chamomile tea can be found on our website.
