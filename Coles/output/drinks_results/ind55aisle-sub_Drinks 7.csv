If you don't happen to be a barista, that's cool. Just heat this Barista Edition oat milk in a container while giving it a whirl until it foams up nicely and then pour yourself an oat latte. And if you don't feel like a latte you will be happy to know that this product tastes just as amazing if you drink it straight or pour it on your granola or put it to work with your cooking skills.

 5 Health Star rated
Available at Woolworths in the long-life milk section.

* One serve contains 0.8g plant sterols, which helps lower cholesterol as part of a healthy and varied diet low in saturated fat and containing 2g plant sterols a day. See pack for more information.

As we age, we are more likely to develop high cholesterol which may lead to heart disease.

Research shows that having foods or drinks enriched with plant sterols can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels, known as the “bad” cholesterol, which is associated with increased risk of heart disease^.

Milk is also a nutrient powerhouse, including protein, calcium and potassium, which can help support overall health and wellness.

^Ras, et al. Br J Nutr, 2014. 112(2): 214-9
What are plant sterols?
Plant sterols are naturally present in plants and have been scientifically proven to help lower total and LDL (Low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol by blocking the absorption of dietary cholesterol in the digestive system.
We have simply added the power of plant sterols to a 5 Health Star rated low fat milk which makes it a convenient and efficient way to take good care of your cholesterol each and everyday.
