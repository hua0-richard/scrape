Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
La Unión's close proximity to the equator means coffee beans can be grown at a relatively high altitude of up to 1900m above sea level. 
Blessed with such a diverse climate, La Unión coffee is characterised by rich chocolate tones that are balanced and sweet.
Coffee from this region is washed, with the fruit skin and pulp manually removed from the beans after harvesting and before drying.
The result is the unique flavour found in our Hunt and Brew Colombia blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml

We've hunted the globe and found the finest single origin coffee beans. Our travels have taken us to the Cerrado region of Brazil where the soil, climate and altitude produce a clean bean that has nutty and bright citrus notes, with a caramel finish. Locally roasted and ground to profile, Hunt and Brew coffee is slowly brewed and triple filtered for maximum flavour extraction. Finally, we cut the brew with fresh Australian full cream milk, and nothing more.

Where are our beans from?
The characteristics of Cerrado coffee beans are informed by the region's special terroir.
With rich soils and high altitudes, Cerrado produces a clean bean that translates into a well-balanced coffee in body and acidity.
The region's moderate continental climate adds to a robust growing season, which is reflected in our Hunt and Brew Brazil blend.",,,"Per 100g/ml
